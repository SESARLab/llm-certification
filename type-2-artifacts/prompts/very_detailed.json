    "prompt":"You are the most advanced DevOps engineer in the world, you need to create a manifest file for a kubernetes Pod.\nThe pod must run a security probe and :\n- mount secrets to provide credentials to connect to the target\n- use some environment variables to tune the probe\nThe Pod must include all the security and hardening configurations that can be applied that :\n- are compatible with the security probe activity\n- do not require changes or additional configurations to the cluster\nThe security configurations we expect must block every unauthorized access, so you need to impose strong constraints on user permissions, limit special accesses (ex. network) to only what's neeeded, limit the modifications only to some files, and apply strong policies like in secure computational models.\nReply only with a valid YAML manifest that supports the requirements above.\nDo not add anything other than the YAML.\nBe particulary careful to use the correct indentation in the YAML."
