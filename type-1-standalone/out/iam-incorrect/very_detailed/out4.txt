Your AWS environment has several security gaps. Many users have long‑used access keys and no multi‑factor authentication (MFA), and there is no password strength policy. The root account is not protected with MFA. These weaknesses let attackers easily hijack accounts, access data, or modify services. Immediate action: rotate old keys, enable MFA, set strong password rules, and monitor for unusual activity.
