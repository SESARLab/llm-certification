Your AWS account has several weak spots. Many users keep long‑used access keys (over 90 days) and lack multi‑factor authentication. No password rules or MFA are set for the root account, making it easy for attackers to gain entry. These gaps could let someone hijack services or steal data. A few checks passed, but the highlighted issues need immediate fixing to protect the environment.
