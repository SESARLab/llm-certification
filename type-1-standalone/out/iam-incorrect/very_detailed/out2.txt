The probe checked your AWS setup and found 9 of 13 tests failed. Many user accounts have old access keys (up to 2 years) that could be stolen, some users can log in without extra “two‑step” verification, and there’s no password strength rule for the account. The root user isn’t protected with a hardware key or MFA. These gaps let attackers easily hijack or misuse your cloud resources, exposing data and services.
