The probe ran fine but found several security gaps. Five users have access keys older than 90 days, root lacks MFA, and three users don’t have MFA on their console passwords. There’s no password policy to enforce strong passwords, and no external Access Analyzer is active. These weaknesses raise the risk of unauthorized access, data exposure, and non‑compliance with industry standards.
