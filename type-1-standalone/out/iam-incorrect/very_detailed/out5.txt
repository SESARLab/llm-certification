The check found 4 of 13 tests passed, meaning most settings are weak. Several staff accounts still use very old keys (over 3 years) and lack multi‑factor authentication, while the root account has no MFA and no strict password rules. These gaps let attackers hijack credentials, steal data, or control services. Fix the keys, enable MFA, and set a strong password policy to protect the cloud.
