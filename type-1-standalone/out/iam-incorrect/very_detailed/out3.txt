Out of 13 security checks, only 4 passed. Many accounts use old access keys and lack two‑factor login (MFA). The root account and some users have no MFA, and there is no password rule or external access monitor. These gaps let attackers reuse old keys, guess passwords, and see data they shouldn’t. It increases the risk of data breaches and unauthorized changes to the cloud environment.
