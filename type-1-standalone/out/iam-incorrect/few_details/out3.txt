Probe ran successfully and checked 13 security controls. Only 4 passed. Findings: several users use old or no MFA, many have expired access keys, no password policy set, and root account lacks MFA. Root keys are absent, which is good, but you should still enable MFA. Access Analyzer is disabled and support role is present. Immediate action: enable MFA, rotate keys, create a strong password policy, and turn on Access Analyzer.
