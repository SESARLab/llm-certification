Your AWS account has some security gaps. The root account lacks MFA and hardware authentication. Several users have old access keys (over 90 days) and a few have no MFA. No password policy is set, and the IAM policies aren’t fully compliant. Most controls pass, but you should rotate old keys, enable MFA for users and root, and create a password policy to strengthen security.
