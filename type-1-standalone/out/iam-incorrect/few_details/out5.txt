The scan ran fine and only 4 of 13 checks passed.  
Many user accounts lack multi‑factor authentication and several access keys are over 90 days old.  
There’s no password policy and the root account has no hardware MFA.  
Positive points: no root access keys, a valid support role, and all IAM server certificates are fine.  
Fix: enable MFA for all users, rotate old keys, and set a strong password policy.
