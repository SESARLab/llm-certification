The security check ran successfully. Out of 13 tests, only 4 passed. The root account has no MFA and no password policy. Several users still have old access keys (over 90 days) and three users lack MFA. Many users have basic IAM policies that may be too permissive. Overall, the account needs better key rotation, MFA, and a stronger password policy.
