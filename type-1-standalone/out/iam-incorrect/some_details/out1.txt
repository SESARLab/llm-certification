The probe ran OK but found several security gaps in your AWS IAM settings.  
• Many users have policies attached and some still use the default “ChangePassword” policy.  
• Several user access keys are over 90 days old and some are more than 2 years old – they should be rotated.  
• Three users lack MFA on their console logins, and the root account has no MFA or hardware token.  
• No password policy is set.  
Other checks (root keys, server certs, CloudShell policy, support role) passed.  
Fix these to tighten security.
