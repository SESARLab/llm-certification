The probe ran successfully and checked 13 security settings. Four of those checks passed, meaning some controls are working. However, 9 checks failed: many users still use very old access keys, several lack two‑factor authentication (MFA), no password rules are set, and the root account has no MFA. A few accounts are fine, but the overall picture shows several critical gaps that should be fixed quickly to improve security.
