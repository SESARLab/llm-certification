The security check ran and found 4 out of 13 settings are okay. Problems include many users with outdated access keys (over 90 days old), some accounts missing multi‑factor authentication, the root account has no MFA, and no password policy is defined. A support role exists, but other controls like external access analysis are missing. Fix these gaps to improve your AWS security posture.
