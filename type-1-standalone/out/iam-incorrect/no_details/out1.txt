**What the assessment found – in plain English**

| Item | Status | What it means | What you should do |
|------|--------|---------------|--------------------|
| **Overall test** | 4/13 passed | The tool ran fine but only 4 of 13 checks were met. | Treat the 9 failures as “things that need fixing.” |
| **CIS‑IAM‑2** | Fail | 7 people can change passwords but the rest don’t have policies that let them do anything useful. | Add proper permissions (e.g., “ChangePassword” only) to those users who need it, and make sure everyone has the right policy attached. |
| **CIS‑IAM‑3** | Fail | 5 users own access keys that are **more than 90 days old** – that’s a long time to keep a secret key in the wild. | Re‑create those keys, rotate them immediately, and delete the old ones. |
| **CIS‑IAM‑4** | Pass | No root‑account access keys exist. | Good – keep the root account key‑free. |
| **CIS‑IAM‑5** | Fail | 3 people who can log into the console don’t have MFA (two‑factor) protection. | Attach an MFA device to those users. |
| **CIS‑IAM‑6** | Fail | The root account does **not** have a hardware MFA token. | Add a hardware (or virtual) MFA device for the root user. |
| **CIS‑IAM‑9** | Fail | The root account has no MFA enabled at all. | Same as above – enable MFA for the root user. |
| **CIS‑IAM‑15 & 16** | Fail | No password policy is defined. | Create a password policy: enforce length (e.g., 12+ chars), complexity, rotation, and no reuse. |
| **CIS‑IAM‑18** | Pass | The required “AWSServiceRoleForSupport” role is present. | Nothing to change. |
| **CIS‑IAM‑22** | Fail | 5 users own keys older than 45 days – a stricter rule than the 90‑day check. | Rotate those keys now; the same 5 users were flagged in the 90‑day check. |
| **CIS‑IAM‑26** | Pass | All server certificates are valid. | No action. |
| **CIS‑IAM‑27** | Pass | No user has the risky “AWSCloudShellFullAccess” policy. | Good. |
| **CIS‑IAM‑28** | Fail | No active “External Access Analyzer” is enabled. | Enable External Access Analyzer so you can see who can access your resources from outside the AWS network. |

### Bottom‑line

- **30+ users need a password policy** – set a minimum length, complexity, rotation, and no‑reuse rules.
- **5–7 users have old access keys** – rotate or delete them immediately.
- **Root account needs MFA** – enable hardware or virtual MFA now.
- **3 console users lack MFA** – add MFA to those accounts.
- **Enable External Access Analyzer** – this gives visibility into cross‑account or internet access.
- **Other controls are already good** – no server cert problems, no CloudShellFullAccess, and the support role is present.

Fixing these items will bring your AWS IAM environment into compliance with the CIS Controls and dramatically reduce the risk of a credential‑based attack.
