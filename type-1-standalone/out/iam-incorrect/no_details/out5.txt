**Quick‑look Summary**

| CIS Check | Result | What it means |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **4/13 checks passed** | 4 checks passed, 9 failed | 4 / 13 of the IAM controls in the report were met, the rest need work. |
| **Access keys** | 9 users have keys older than the recommended age | IAM best practice says keys should be rotated every 90 days (or 45 days for stricter rules). |
| **MFA** | Root user has no MFA; 3 users with console passwords lack MFA | Multi‑factor authentication protects against compromised credentials. |
| **Password policy** | No password policy defined | Without a policy users can set weak passwords. |
| **Root access keys** | No root keys found | Good – root keys are not being used. |
| **Support role** | Exists | Good – this role is required for AWS Support. |
| **Server certificates** | All valid | No expired or invalid IAM certificates. |
| **AWSCloudShellFullAccess** | No user has this policy | Good – no unnecessary full‑cloud‑shell access. |
| **Access Analyzer** | Not enabled | External visibility of IAM permissions is missing. |

## What the report tells us

1. **Policy & MFA**  
   * Only **3 of the 12 users with console passwords** have MFA enabled.  
   * The **root account** has no MFA at all (neither software nor hardware).  
   * A password policy hasn’t been set, so users can create weak passwords.

2. **Access Keys**  
   * **7 users** own access keys that are **older than 90 days**.  
   * **5 users** have keys older than 45 days.  
   * The oldest key is **889 days** old – far beyond the rotation limit.

3. **Users & Policies**  
   * All 9 users *do not* have the risky `AWSCloudShellFullAccess` policy.  
   * The support role for AWS Support is in place.

4. **Certificates & Analyzer**  
   * All IAM server certificates are still valid.  
   * No Active External Access Analyzer – you have no audit view of how your IAM policies are accessed from outside your account.

## Why it matters

| Control | Why it’s important | Risk if not fixed |
|---------|--------------------|-------------------|
| **MFA on root & users** | Adds a second factor of proof of identity | Attackers who obtain a password can still act on the account. |
| **Password policy** | Forces stronger passwords, limits reuse | Password guessing or credential stuffing becomes easier. |
| **Key rotation** | Reduces window of exposure if a key leaks | Stale keys that haven’t been rotated are a large attack surface. |
| **Access Analyzer** | Shows who can access your resources from outside | Hidden privileges can be abused by insiders or attackers. |

## Simple next‑steps

| Step | What to do | Why |
|------|------------|-----|
| 1 | **Enable MFA on root and all users with console passwords.** | Immediate mitigation against credential compromise. |
| 2 | **Create a password policy** (min length 14, enforce complexity, block reuse). | Prevent weak passwords. |
| 3 | **Rotate all old access keys** (delete keys older than 90 days, create new ones). | Close stale credential holes. |
| 4 | **Enable External Access Analyzer** and review any findings. | Gain visibility into cross‑account permissions. |
| 5 | **Review the IAM users’ policies** for any unnecessary permissions. | Limit over‑privileged accounts. |
| 6 | **Document the changes** and run the assessment again. | Verify that the fixes are effective and maintain compliance. |

**Bottom line**  
The account is partially secure: no root keys, no risky full‑cloud‑shell policy, and certificates are fine. However, many users lack MFA, the password policy is missing, and many access keys are outdated. Fixing those items will bring the account closer to CIS benchmark compliance and reduce the attack surface.
