**What the assessment found – in plain English**

| Check | Status | What it means | What you should do |
|-------|--------|---------------|--------------------|
| **Probe ran OK** | ✅ | The tool finished and gave you a report. | No action needed. |
| **4/13 checks passed** | ⚠️ | Only 4 of the 13 specific controls were satisfied. | Focus on the failed ones – they are the biggest risks. |

### Controls that *failed* (high‑risk)

| Control | Why it failed | Immediate fix |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| **CIS IAM.2 – “Policy attachment”** | 7 users have policies attached; the others only have a very limited *IAMUserChangePassword* policy. | Review each user’s policies. Remove any that are unnecessary or replace them with more restrictive, job‑role‑based policies. |
| **CIS IAM.3 – “Old access keys (90 days)”** | 5 users still have long‑lived access keys (several years old). | Rotate those keys now – create a new key, test, then delete the old one. |
| **CIS IAM.5 – “MFA for console users”** | 3 users (almaviva.dev, engineering.dev, kevin.pease) have no MFA device. | Enable MFA for those users. Use virtual MFA (Google Authenticator, etc.) if hardware MFA isn’t available. |
| **CIS IAM.6 – “Root hardware MFA”** | Root user doesn’t have a hardware MFA token. | Add a hardware MFA device to the root account (or a strong virtual MFA as a backup). |
| **CIS IAM.9 – “Root MFA”** | Root account is not MFA‑protected. | Enable MFA on the root account (same token as above). |
| **CIS IAM.15 & 16 – “Password policy”** | No password policy exists – users can set any password. | Create a password policy that requires a minimum length, complexity, and rotation period. |
| **CIS IAM.22 – “Old access keys (45 days)”** | 5 users have keys older than 45 days (some over a year). | Rotate these keys as soon as possible. |
| **CIS IAM.28 – “External Access Analyzer”** | No active Access Analyzer – you can’t see external sharing or accidental exposures. | Enable the IAM Access Analyzer to automatically discover cross‑account or external permissions. |

### Controls that *passed* (low‑risk)

| Control | Result |
|---------|--------|
| **CIS IAM.4 – “Root access keys”** | No root access keys – good. |
| **CIS IAM.18 – “Support role”** | Support role exists – fine. |
| **CIS IAM.26 – “Server certificates”** | All IAM certificates are valid. |
| **CIS IAM.27 – “CloudShellFullAccess”** | No user has the risky CloudShellFullAccess policy. |
| **CIS IAM.2‑27** (other sub‑checks) | No issues found. |

### Quick next‑steps

1. **Rotate old keys** – focus first on those that are *over a year old* (e.g., alex.dellabruna, almaviva.dev).  
2. **Enable MFA** for the three users without it and for the root account (both virtual and, if you have a device, hardware).  
3. **Create a password policy** – set length, complexity, rotation, and lock‑out rules.  
4. **Enable Access Analyzer** – start it in the account and let it surface any unintended public or cross‑account permissions.  
5. **Audit policies** – review the 7 users with attached policies and tighten or replace as needed.

By tackling these areas you’ll cover the biggest gaps that could let an attacker stay hidden or misuse long‑lived credentials. Once those are fixed, run the probe again – the number of passed checks should jump dramatically.
