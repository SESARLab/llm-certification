## Quick‑look Summary  
- **Probe ran OK** – the tool finished without crashing.  
- **4 out of 13 controls passed** (30 %).  
- Most problems involve **IAM user access keys, missing MFA, and no password policy**.  

Below is a plain‑English walk‑through of each finding and what you can do next.

---

### 1. IAM Users – Policies Attached (CIS IAM.2)
| Status | Users |
|--------|-------|
| **Compliant** | `cct`, `kevin.pease`, `sqs-user-cis-aws` |
| **Not compliant** | `alex.dellabruna`, `almaviva.dev`, `claudio.ardagna`, `engineering.dev`, `marco.anisetti`, `nicola.bena`, `ruslan.bondaruc` |

**What it means**  
- All 7 non‑compliant users only have the *IAMUserChangePassword* policy.  
- They are missing the additional permissions the organization requires (e.g., least‑privilege policies).

**Action**  
- Review the policy set that should be attached to each user.  
- Apply the missing policies or adjust the IAM group assignments.

---

### 2. Old Access Keys (CIS IAM.3 & 22)

| User | Key age | Non‑compliant if > 90 days | Non‑compliant if > 45 days |
|------|---------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| `alex.dellabruna` | 804 days | ✔ | ✔ |
| `almaviva.dev` | 889 days | ✔ | ✔ |
| `cct` | 654 days | ✔ | ✔ |
| `kevin.pease` | 204 days | ✔ | ✔ |
| `sqs-user-cis-aws` | 321 days | ✔ | ✔ |
| (others) | < 90 days | ✖ | ✖ |

**What it means**  
- Five users have keys older than 90 days, and six are older than 45 days – well beyond the CIS recommended maximum.  
- Old keys can be a security risk if they’re compromised.

**Action**  
1. **Rotate** those keys (delete the old ones, create new keys).  
2. **Disable** or delete any key that isn’t actively used.  
3. Set up automated rotation or a scheduled review.

### 3. Root User Security (CIS IAM.4, 6, 9)

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Root access keys | None (good) |
| Hardware MFA enabled | **No** |
| MFA enabled (any) | **No** |

**What it means**  
- No root keys is good, but the root account **lacks MFA** – the biggest protection against accidental or malicious sign‑ins.

**Action**  
- Enable **Hardware MFA** for the root account.  
- Add a **virtual MFA** (if hardware isn’t available) as a backup.

---

### 4. Password Policy (CIS IAM.15 & 16)

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Policy exists | **No** |
| Minimum length / reuse prevention | N/A |

**What it means**  
- There is **no password policy** – users can set weak passwords, and old passwords can be reused.

**Action**  
- Define a strong password policy:  
  - Minimum length (e.g., 12‑14 chars).  
  - Require upper/lowercase, numbers, and symbols.  
  - Enforce password reuse prevention (e.g., 24‑month).  
- Apply the policy to all IAM users and console logins.

---

### 5. MFA for IAM Users (CIS IAM.5)

| User | MFA status |
|------|------------|
| `almaviva.dev`, `engineering.dev`, `kevin.pease` | **Missing** |
| All others | **Has MFA** |

**What it means**  
- Three users with console passwords have **no MFA** – a higher risk for credential compromise.

**Action**  
- Prompt those users to enable MFA immediately.  
- Consider automating MFA requirement via a policy that denies console access without MFA.

---

### 6. AWS Service Role & Certificates (CIS IAM.18, 26)

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Support role exists | ✔ |
| IAM server certificates valid | ✔ |

**What it means**  
- These areas are fine – no immediate action needed.

---

### 7. CloudShell Policy (CIS IAM.27)

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| `AWSCloudShellFullAccess` attached | **No users** |

**What it means**  
- Good – no one has overly‑permissive CloudShell access.

---

### 8. External Access Analyzer (CIS IAM.28)

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| External Access Analyzer enabled | **No** |

**What it means**  
- The account cannot detect potential external data leaks (e.g., S3 buckets open to the internet).

**Action**  
- Enable an **External Access Analyzer** to audit and alert on public access or cross‑account sharing.

## Quick‑Action Checklist

| Priority | Task | Who | Due |
|----------|------|-----|-----|
| **High** | Enable root hardware MFA | Security admin | 3 days |
| **High** | Create & enforce a password policy | IAM admin | 3 days |
| **High** | Enable MFA for `almaviva.dev`, `engineering.dev`, `kevin.pease` | IAM admin | 3 days |
| **Medium** | Rotate all old access keys (≥ 45 days) | IAM admin | 7 days |
| **Medium** | Apply missing IAM policies to the 7 non‑compliant users | IAM admin | 7 days |
| **Low** | Enable External Access Analyzer | Security admin | 14 days |

### Bottom Line

Your environment is **partially compliant** with CIS best practices. The biggest risks lie in **missing MFA, old access keys, and no password policy**. Fixing these will dramatically tighten your security posture. Once those are addressed, you’ll be well on your way to a fully compliant IAM configuration.
