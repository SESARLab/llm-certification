**What the report says in plain English**

- The security scan ran without any problems – “The probe executed successfully!”
- The scan checked the *CIS KMS.4* rule, which is about key‑management‑service (KMS) keys and their automatic rotation.
- All seven KMS keys that were found on your system (`keyId1` … `keyId7`) are correctly set up to rotate automatically.  
  *No keys are missing rotation or misconfigured.*  
- Because every key is compliant, the scan reports a perfect “1/1 succeeded” – one test, and it passed.

**Bottom line:**  
Your KMS keys are all configured properly with rotation enabled, and the probe didn’t detect any issues. Your key‑management security is in good shape.
