### What the report says in plain English

| What was checked | Result | What it means |
|------------------|--------|---------------|
| **Overall test** | ✅ “The probe executed successfully!” | The security scan ran without any errors. |
| **Summary** | ✅ 1/1 succeeded | All the checks that were supposed to run did complete successfully. |
| **CIS KMS.4 (Key Management Service – key rotation)** | ✅ Passed | Every one of your 7 encryption keys has key‑rotation turned on. |
| **Keys listed** | `keyId1 … keyId7` | Those are the keys that were verified. |
| **Non‑compliant keys** | ❌ None | There were no keys missing rotation or otherwise out of compliance. |
| **Known CVEs** | None found | The scan didn’t flag any known vulnerabilities. |

### Bottom line

- Your key‑management system is fully compliant with the CIS best practice that requires key rotation (CIS KMS.4).  
- All keys are correctly configured, so the risk of an attacker being able to reuse or freeze a key is mitigated.  
- No CVEs or other security issues were discovered during this assessment.

In short: **Everything is working as expected and you’re not exposed to any known key‑management risks.**
