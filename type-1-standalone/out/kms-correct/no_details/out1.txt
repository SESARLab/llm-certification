**Security Assessment Summary – Simple Version**

| What the test looked at | Result |
|------------------------|--------|
| **Overall test** | ✔️ **Passed** – the probe ran without any problems. |
| **Key‑Management Service (KMS) – “Rotation” rule (CIS KMS.4)** | ✔️ **All keys are compliant** – every key in your system (7 in total) is set to rotate automatically, which keeps them secure. |
| **Non‑compliant keys** | None – there are no keys that need fixing. |

### What does this mean?

- **The probe succeeded**: The automated check finished and reported no issues.
- **Key rotation is on**: All your encryption keys change regularly (as recommended by security best practices), so the chance of an old key being compromised is very low.
- **No missing or weak keys**: Every key your organization uses is covered by the rule, so you’re not leaving any keys unprotected.

### Why is this important?

- **Automatic key rotation** reduces the risk that an attacker can reuse a stolen key.
- Having **no non‑compliant keys** means your current key‑management policy is working correctly.

### Next steps

- **Keep the rotation schedule** in place and make sure new keys are added with rotation enabled.
- Continue running these checks periodically (e.g., monthly or quarterly) to stay compliant.
- If you add new services or change your key‑management setup, run the probe again to confirm everything still passes.

**Bottom line:** Your key‑management system is secure and fully compliant with the CIS KMS.4 standard—great job!
