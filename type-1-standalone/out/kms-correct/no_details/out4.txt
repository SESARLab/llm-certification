**Quick Take‑away**

- The test ran without any errors – it “executed successfully”.
- The tool checked the **CIS KMS.4** rule, which ensures that every cryptographic key in your Key Management Service (KMS) is set to rotate automatically.
- **All 7 keys (keyId1 … keyId7) passed** the rotation check.
- No keys were found that violate the rule, and no Common Vulnerabilities (CVE) were reported.

**What this means for you**

Your key rotation policy is working as expected – every key will automatically change at the scheduled interval, reducing the risk of long‑term exposure. No immediate security gaps were detected in this area. If you keep the same rotation settings and add new keys, they’ll automatically be covered by this rule.
