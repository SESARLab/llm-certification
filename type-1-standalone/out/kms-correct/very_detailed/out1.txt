Your cloud security check ran fine and found no problems. All seven encryption keys in your AWS environment have “rotation” turned on, meaning each key is automatically updated every few months. This keeps your data protected, as old keys are replaced and hard‑to‑steal secrets are limited. In short, your key management is secure, so no immediate risk to your applications.
