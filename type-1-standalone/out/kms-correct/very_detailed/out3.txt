The security check ran and found everything in order. All seven encryption keys in your AWS account have automatic rotation turned on, meaning they change regularly and reduce the chance of a stolen key being useful for long. No non‑compliant keys were detected, so there is no immediate risk from key management. This means your data encryption is following best practices and is well protected.
