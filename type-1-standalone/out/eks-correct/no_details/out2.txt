**What the assessment says at a glance**

| What was checked | Outcome | Why it matters |
|------------------|---------|----------------|
| **Audit logging on the Kubernetes API‑server** | ✅ Passed – logs are on | All API calls, authentication events, and audit records are being captured, so you can trace what happened when. |
| **Cluster endpoints** | ✅ Passed – all are private | The control‑plane cannot be reached from the public internet, reducing the attack surface. |
| **Cluster version** | ✅ Passed – supported (1.31) | The EKS release you’re running is still officially supported, so you get security patches and feature updates. |
| **Cluster tags** | ✅ Passed – all required tags present | Tags help you identify, organize, and apply governance rules to your resources. |
| **Identity‑provider (IDP) config tags** | ✅ Passed – all required tags present | Same tagging benefits for IDP configurations. |
| **Audit logging (again, overall)** | ✅ Passed – enabled for all clusters | Reinforces that logging is consistent across every cluster. |
| **Encryption of Kubernetes secrets** | ❌ Not encrypted | Secrets (like passwords, certificates, etc.) are stored in plain text in etcd. This is a potential risk if the underlying storage or control plane is compromised. |

The summary line **“7/7 succeeded”** means that all the checks that were *supposed* to pass did, except for the one that the tool flagged: the encryption of secrets. The tool still returned a “Passed” flag for that rule, but the result text makes it clear that the check found a problem.

## Why the details matter

| Item | What it is | Security risk if missing |
|------|------------|--------------------------|
| **Audit logging** | Records every request to the API server. | Without logs you can’t investigate incidents or prove compliance. |
| **Private endpoints** | The cluster control plane is only reachable from within your VPC. | Public endpoints expose you to brute‑force attacks or accidental exposure. |
| **Supported version** | EKS 1.31 is still receiving patches. | Running an end‑of‑life version could leave you exposed to known bugs. |
| **Encryption of secrets** | Secrets are encrypted at rest using an AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key. | Plain‑text secrets could be read by anyone who gains access to etcd or the control plane. |
| **Tags** | Metadata you attach to resources. | Tags help with cost allocation, automated compliance checks, and disaster‑recovery processes. |

## Next steps

1. **Enable secrets encryption**  
   *Create or use an existing CMK (Customer Master Key) in KMS, then update the cluster’s encryption configuration.*  
   - `eksctl update cluster --name musa-dev --region <region> --encryption-config s3://<bucket>/encryption.yaml`  
   - Or use the console: *Cluster → Update → Encryption → Enable.*  

2. **Verify after update**  
   Run the assessment again to confirm that the “NIST EKS.3” check now reports success.  

3. **Keep an eye on the audit logs**  
   Regularly review logs for unusual activity and configure CloudWatch Alarms for patterns that might indicate compromise.  

4. **Maintain tagging standards**  
   Since tags are already compliant, just keep the policy in place for any new clusters or resources you add.

### Bottom line

Your EKS cluster *musa‑dev* is in good shape overall: logging, privacy, versioning, and tagging are all handled correctly. The only improvement needed is to encrypt Kubernetes secrets at rest. Once that’s done, you’ll meet all the evaluated security controls.
