**What the report says – in plain English**

| Check | What it was looking for | Result | What you see in the report |
|-------|--------------------------|--------|----------------------------|
| **CIS EKS 2.1.1** | Audit logging on the API‑server is turned on | ✅ Passed | `api`, `audit`, and `authenticator` log types are enabled. |
| **NIST EKS.1** | All cluster endpoints must be private (not exposed to the public Internet) | ✅ Passed | The only cluster, **musa‑dev**, is marked `is_public: false`. |
| **NIST EKS.2** | The cluster must run a supported Kubernetes version | ✅ Passed | **musa‑dev** runs version **1.31**, which is listed as supported. |
| **NIST EKS.3** | Check whether secrets are encrypted at rest | ✅ Passed (but **not encrypted**) | **musa‑dev** has `secrets_encrypted: false` and no encryption config. The rule says “some clusters do not encrypt Kubernetes secrets” – the test is satisfied because the cluster *does* fall into that category, but it’s a flag you might want to address. |
| **NIST EKS.6** | All clusters must have the required tags | ✅ Passed | **musa‑dev** has a user tag `tag1`. No missing tags. |
| **NIST EKS.7** | All Identity‑Provider (IdP) configurations must have the required tags | ✅ Passed | No IdP configs are listed, but the rule still passes because there are no missing tags. |
| **NIST EKS.8** | Audit logging must be enabled for every cluster | ✅ Passed | Audit logging is on and the same log types as CIS are enabled. |

### Bottom line

- **All seven checks succeeded** – the `pretty_result` says “The probe executed successfully!” and the summary shows `7/7 succeeded`.
- Your cluster **musa‑dev** is private, up‑to‑date, correctly tagged, and has audit logging enabled.
- The only potential improvement is **encrypting Kubernetes secrets**. The rule flagged that the cluster does not encrypt secrets, which is not a violation of the test itself, but it is a best‑practice recommendation that you may want to address.

### Quick next steps

1. **Enable secrets encryption** (e.g., use a customer‑managed CMK or a Kubernetes secret encryption provider).  
2. Review any other clusters you may have in the future to make sure they meet the same criteria.
