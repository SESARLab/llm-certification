**What the report says (in plain English)**  

| What was checked | Result | What it means |
|------------------|--------|---------------|
| **Audit logging** (CIS EKS 2.1.1) | ✅ Pass | The cluster’s API server is set to record every request – the logs are being captured for “api”, “audit” and “authenticator” events. |
| **Cluster endpoints** (NIST EKS.1) | ✅ Pass | All endpoints that users hit are behind a private network; no public-facing endpoints. |
| **Cluster version** (NIST EKS.2) | ✅ Pass | The Kubernetes version running in the cluster (v1.31) is still supported by AWS. |
| **Secrets encryption** (NIST EKS.3) | ✅ Pass *but* | **Kubernetes secrets are *not* encrypted at rest.** The test considers the current configuration acceptable, but this is a potential security risk if you store sensitive data in secrets. |
| **Cluster tags** (NIST EKS.6) | ✅ Pass | The cluster has all required AWS tags (e.g., “tag1”) in place. |
| **IDP (Identity Provider) tags** (NIST EKS.7) | ✅ Pass | Any configured identity‑provider settings also carry the required tags. |
| **Audit logging on all clusters** (NIST EKS.8) | ✅ Pass | Audit logging is enabled cluster‑wide and the same log types as above are active. |

### Bottom line

- **All seven automated checks succeeded** – the probe ran without error (“The probe executed successfully!”).  
- Your EKS cluster **“musa‑dev”** is following most best‑practice controls: logs are enabled, endpoints are private, the Kubernetes version is supported, and tagging is correct.  
- The **only missing security control** is **encryption of secrets at rest**. If you’re storing passwords, tokens, or other secrets in Kubernetes, consider enabling encryption (AWS provides a mechanism to enable it via a `secretsEncryptionConfig`).  

**Next steps:**  
1. Review whether any secrets are stored in the cluster.  
2. If yes, enable encryption to avoid potential exposure if the etcd data store is compromised.  
3. Re‑run the assessment after making changes to confirm the issue is fixed.  

That’s all the key take‑aways from the report!
