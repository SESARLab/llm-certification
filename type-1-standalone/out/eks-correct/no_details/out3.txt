**What the assessment did**

A quick “health‑check” ran against your Amazon EKS cluster called **musa‑dev**.  
It looked at 7 different security best‑practice checks (based on CIS and NIST guidance) and reported whether each one was met.

| # | Check | What it looks at | Result |
|---|-------|-----------------|--------|
| 1 | **CIS EKS 2.1.1** | API‑server audit logging | **✓** – logging is turned on and the expected log types (`api`, `audit`, `authenticator`) are enabled |
| 2 | **NIST EKS.1** | Network access to the cluster | **✓** – the control plane is only reachable from inside your VPC (no public endpoints) |
| 3 | **NIST EKS.2** | Cluster version support | **✓** – the running Kubernetes version (`1.31`) is still supported by AWS |
| 4 | **NIST EKS.3** | Encryption of Kubernetes secrets | **✗** – the cluster is **not** encrypting secrets in etcd |
| 5 | **NIST EKS.6** | Resource tagging | **✓** – the cluster has all required tags (e.g., `tag1`) |
| 6 | **NIST EKS.7** | Tagging of IdP (Identity Provider) configs | **✓** – all IdP configurations are properly tagged |
| 7 | **NIST EKS.8** | Audit logging | **✓** – audit logging is enabled and the right log types are collected |

**Overall status**

*The probe ran successfully* (`integer_result = 0`, `pretty_result = "The probe executed successfully!"`).  
All 7 checks passed **except** the secret‑encryption check. No CVEs were found in the `refined.cve` list.

**What you should do next**

1. **Enable encryption of Kubernetes secrets**  
   - Use an AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key to encrypt etcd secrets.  
   - This prevents anyone who can access the etcd data store from reading sensitive values (API keys, passwords, etc.).  
   - Once enabled, re‑run the assessment – the NIST EKS.3 check will then pass.

2. **Keep an eye on version support**  
   - Version `1.31` is supported now, but future updates may end support. Plan to upgrade before the end‑of‑support date.

3. **Maintain tagging and audit logging**  
   - The cluster is already compliant in these areas, but continue to enforce tag policies and review audit logs regularly.

**Bottom line**

Your EKS cluster is configured very securely overall—private endpoints, audit logging, supported Kubernetes version, and proper tagging are all in place. The only missing piece is encrypting secrets, which is the next quick step to fully meet the recommended security posture.
