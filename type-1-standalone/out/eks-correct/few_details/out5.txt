The security check ran smoothly and found everything working as expected. All 7 tests passed: logs are on, cluster endpoints stay private, the Kubernetes version is supported, required tags are present, and audit logging is active. One area to improve is secret encryption – currently no secrets are encrypted. Addressing that will boost data protection.
