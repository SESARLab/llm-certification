Your cluster checks ran fine—every test passed. All endpoints are private, the Kubernetes version is supported, and audit logging is on. Tags are present for clusters and identity providers. However, one cluster’s secrets aren’t encrypted, so we recommend adding encryption for added security. No vulnerabilities were found. Great job keeping your environment secure.
