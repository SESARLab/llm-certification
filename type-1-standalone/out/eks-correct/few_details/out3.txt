The assessment ran fine and found no major problems. All safety checks passed: the API logs are on, every cluster is reachable only from inside the network, the Kubernetes version is supported, all required tags are set, and audit logging is enabled. The only noted shortfall is that Kubernetes secrets are not encrypted. No known CVEs were found. Overall, your cluster is in good shape.
