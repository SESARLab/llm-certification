Your Kubernetes cluster (musa‑dev) was checked and all security controls passed: logs are enabled, all network points are private, required tags are present, and the cluster version is supported. One caveat: secrets are not encrypted – consider enabling encryption for added protection. Overall, the assessment was successful and your cluster is in good shape.
