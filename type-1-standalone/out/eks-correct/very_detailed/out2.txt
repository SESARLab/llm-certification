The scan checked your AWS Kubernetes setup. All 7 tests succeeded: audit logs are on, cluster ends are private, versions are supported, required tags exist, and logging is enabled. However, one cluster’s secrets are not encrypted. That means sensitive data (like passwords or tokens) could be read if someone gains access. Encrypting secrets protects them. Fixing this reduces the risk of data leaks.
