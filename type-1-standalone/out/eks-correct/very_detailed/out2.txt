Your cloud cluster passed all safety checks: logs are on, endpoints are private, software is up‑to‑date, and all required tags and audit logs are set.  
The only issue is that one cluster’s internal secrets are not encrypted. If an attacker gains access, they could read those secrets and compromise your applications. Enable encryption to keep sensitive data safe.
