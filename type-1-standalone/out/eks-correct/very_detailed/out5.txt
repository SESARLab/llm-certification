Your cloud test ran fine—no big problems were found. All safety checks passed: the control‑panel logs are on, the cluster can’t be reached from the public internet, it’s up‑to‑date, and the right labels are in place. The only shortfall is that the cluster’s secret data isn’t encrypted, meaning anyone with access could read sensitive information. Encrypting those secrets would add an extra layer of protection.
