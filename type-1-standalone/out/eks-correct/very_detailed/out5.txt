The security scan ran fine. Your cluster logs everything, uses private connections, runs a supported version, and has the right tags. However, it found that Kubernetes secrets aren’t encrypted. That means passwords, keys, or other sensitive data stored in the cluster could be read by anyone who gains access. Encrypting these secrets protects this information and reduces the risk of a data breach.
