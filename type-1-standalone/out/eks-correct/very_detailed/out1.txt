The security scan finished without errors (7 of 7 tests passed). All cluster access is private, the software version is supported, audit logging is on, and necessary tags are present—great for tracking and accountability. One issue: Kubernetes secrets aren’t encrypted. If those secrets (like passwords or keys) are exposed, attackers could gain access to your data or services. Fixing that will harden the cluster’s overall security.
