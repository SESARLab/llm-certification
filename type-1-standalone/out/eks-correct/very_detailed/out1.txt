The security scan ran successfully and all checks passed: logs record every action, the cluster is private, the software version is up‑to‑date, and all required tags are present. However, the cluster’s Kubernetes secrets are not encrypted. If an attacker gets inside, they could read passwords, keys, or other sensitive data, potentially compromising the application. Enabling secret encryption would protect this critical information.
