The assessment found everything is working well – audit logs are on, cluster endpoints stay private, the software version is supported, and all tags are present. However, one issue remains: the cluster’s Kubernetes secrets are not encrypted. Without encryption, sensitive data (like passwords or tokens) could be read by anyone who gains access to the cluster, increasing the risk of data leaks or compromise. Fixing this will strengthen overall security.
