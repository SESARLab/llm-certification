Your AWS Kubernetes cluster passed all checks except that it doesn’t encrypt stored secrets. That means if attackers gain access, they could read passwords or keys. All other controls – logging, private network access, up‑to‑date software, proper tags – are in place, keeping the environment largely secure and auditable. Addressing secret encryption will reduce data exposure risk.
