The scan shows your AWS EKS cluster (musa‑dev) follows most security best practices: logs are enabled, endpoints are private, the cluster version is supported, and all required tags are present. However, Kubernetes secrets aren’t encrypted. Without encryption, anyone who can access the cluster could read sensitive data (passwords, keys), increasing the risk of data leaks or a breach.
