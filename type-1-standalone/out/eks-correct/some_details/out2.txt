The security check ran fine and found no major problems. All cluster endpoints are private, the cluster version is supported, required tags are present, and audit logging (tracking all API calls) is enabled. One area to improve: Kubernetes secrets aren’t currently encrypted, which could expose sensitive data if accessed. Otherwise, the configuration looks solid.
