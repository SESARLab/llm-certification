The security scan ran smoothly and found no major problems. All seven checks succeeded: audit logs are on, all cluster endpoints are private, the cluster version is supported, tags are correct, and audit logging is enabled. The only issue is that Kubernetes secrets are not encrypted for the “musa‑dev” cluster. This is the single area that needs improvement.
