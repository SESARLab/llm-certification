Your security scan ran fine and found no serious problems.  
All seven checks passed:  
• The API server logs events, the cluster is on a supported version (1.31), and all endpoints are private.  
• Every cluster and identity‑provider configuration has the required tags, and audit logging is active.  
The only note is that Kubernetes secrets in the “musa‑dev” cluster aren’t encrypted, so you might want to add encryption for extra protection.
