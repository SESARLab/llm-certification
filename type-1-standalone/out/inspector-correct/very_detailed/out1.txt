The probe checked four security settings in your AWS account and all four passed.  
This means your EC2, container, and Lambda code are continuously scanned for known weaknesses.  
No configuration errors were found, so your applications are protected from common exploits that could allow attackers to steal data, take control, or disrupt services.  
Keep the scans enabled and monitor any future alerts to maintain this security posture.
