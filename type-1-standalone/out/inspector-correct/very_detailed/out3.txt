Your AWS environment passed all four security checks. Amazon Inspector is correctly set up for virtual servers, container images, and Lambda functions, so your code and services are routinely scanned for weaknesses. This lowers the risk that attackers find hidden flaws. While no configuration errors were found, regular scans are still needed to keep your applications safe and meet compliance standards.
