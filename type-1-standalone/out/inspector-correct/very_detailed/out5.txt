The security probe ran successfully and found that all four Amazon Inspector scans are working correctly. This means that your EC2 servers, container images, and Lambda functions are regularly checked for known security problems. With these scans active, potential weaknesses are identified early and can be fixed before attackers exploit them. No configuration errors were found, so your cloud setup is currently secure.
