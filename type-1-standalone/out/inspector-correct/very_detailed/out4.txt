The security scan checked four key parts of your AWS setup and found everything is correctly configured. All services (EC2, container images, and Lambda functions) have active security scans that detect problems early. No vulnerabilities were discovered, and no known CVEs were found. Your applications are currently protected, but keep the tools enabled and update regularly for ongoing safety.
