**Security scan results:**  
The probe checked four key AWS security checks and all passed.  
• EC2 instances are monitored for vulnerabilities.  
• Docker images (ECR) are scanned for issues.  
• Lambda functions have code and standard security scans running.  
No known weaknesses (CVEs) were found. In short, your AWS setup is correctly protected against common configuration mistakes, keeping your applications safer.
