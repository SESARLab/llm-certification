**Quick‑look summary**

| What was checked | Result | What it means |
|------------------|--------|---------------|
| **Amazon Inspector – EC2 scans** | ✅ Passed | The security tool is actively scanning all your Amazon EC2 servers for known weaknesses. |
| **Amazon Inspector – ECR scans** | ✅ Passed | Your Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) images are being scanned for vulnerabilities every time they’re pushed. |
| **Amazon Inspector – Lambda code scans** | ✅ Passed | Every new Lambda function you upload is automatically checked for security issues. |
| **Amazon Inspector – Lambda standard scans** | ✅ Passed | The standard runtime checks for your Lambda functions are turned on. |
| **Overall probe** | ✅ “The probe executed successfully!” | The assessment ran without errors and found nothing wrong. |

**What does this tell you?**

1. **Everything is enabled and working** – All four recommended security checks are on, so your AWS environment is covered by Amazon Inspector.
2. **No known vulnerabilities detected** – The `refined.cve` list is empty, and the raw results say “4/4 succeeded.” That means the tool didn’t find any CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures) in your current resources.
3. **Security posture is healthy** – With these scans enabled, new code, containers, and EC2 instances will automatically be checked, giving you early warning if anything new is introduced that could be risky.

**Next steps (optional)**

- Keep the scanning enabled; it will continue to protect your environment.
- If you ever add new services (e.g., RDS, S3, etc.), consider adding those to the inspection policy.
- Review any findings from future scans to stay ahead of potential threats.

**Bottom line:** Your AWS security checks are all on and no issues were found – great job keeping your environment safe!
