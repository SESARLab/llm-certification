### Quick‑look Summary

| Item | What the report says | What it means for you |
|------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| **Probe status** | “The probe executed successfully!” (integer = 1) | The tool ran without crashing – it can now give you real results. |
| **Number of tests** | 0/4 succeeded | Out of the four security checks the tool ran, none of them passed. |
| **CVE findings** | `cve` list is empty | The scan didn’t discover any known CVEs in your environment. |
| **Specific failures** | All four *Amazon Inspector* checks failed | Your AWS resources are not protected by Amazon’s automated vulnerability scanning. |

## What the failures actually are

| Check | Description | Why it matters |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **CIS Inspector.1** | **EC2 scanning** | Your Amazon EC2 instances aren’t being inspected for OS‑level and application vulnerabilities. |
| **CIS Inspector.2** | **ECR scanning** | Your Elastic Container Registry images aren’t being scanned for container‑specific security issues. |
| **CIS Inspector.3** | **Lambda code scanning** | Lambda functions aren’t checked for insecure code patterns or missing best‑practice imports. |
| **CIS Inspector.4** | **Lambda standard scanning** | The built‑in “standard” security checks for Lambda (e.g., permissions, runtime vulnerabilities) aren’t enabled. |

These checks are part of the **CIS (Center for Internet Security) benchmark for AWS**. Passing them is a common requirement for compliance programs (HIPAA, PCI, SOC‑2, etc.).

## What you should do next

1. **Enable Amazon Inspector**  
   * In the AWS console, turn on **Inspector** for the regions where your resources live.  
   * Configure a **Assessment target** that includes the EC2 instances, ECR repositories, and Lambda functions you want protected.

2. **Schedule regular scans**  
   * Set up a recurring assessment (e.g., monthly) so new code or images are automatically checked.

3. **Review the findings**  
   * Once scanning is enabled, Inspector will produce a list of vulnerabilities and remediation advice.  
   * Prioritize fixes based on severity and exposure.

4. **Add additional controls if needed**  
   * For container workloads, consider using **Amazon ECR image scanning** and **AWS CodeBuild** for CI/CD pipeline checks.  
   * For Lambda, enable **AWS Lambda Layer scanning** if you’re using third‑party libraries.

5. **Document and report**  
   * Capture the results and remediation steps in your security documentation.  
   * This will help you satisfy auditors and internal policy reviews.

## Bottom line

- The assessment ran fine, but **none of your AWS services are protected by Amazon Inspector’s vulnerability scans**.
- Turn Inspector on and set up regular scans to start detecting and remediating potential security gaps.
- No CVEs were found, but the lack of scanning could let vulnerabilities slip through unnoticed. Fixing these controls is a quick and high‑impact way to strengthen your security posture.
