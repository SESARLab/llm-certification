**What the report says – in plain words**

| Item | What it means |
|------|----------------|
| **Probe ran** | The tool executed without crashing (the “pretty_result” says “The probe executed successfully!”). |
| **Score** | `integer_result: 1` – the tool returned a “positive” status, but that just means the scan finished. |
| **Findings** | 0 out of 4 checks passed. All four checks are about **Amazon Inspector** – the AWS security‑scanning service. The checks say that you have **not enabled Inspector scanning** for: |
| 1. **EC2 instances** (cloud servers) |
| 2. **ECR images** (container images stored in AWS) |
| 3. **Lambda function code** (the source you upload) |
| 4. **Lambda function standard scanning** (the automatic security checks for Lambda) |

No CVE (common vulnerability identifiers) were reported – the scan didn’t find any specific known exploits.

### Why does this matter?

Amazon Inspector is a built‑in security scanner that automatically looks for configuration issues, missing patches, and known vulnerabilities in:

* Your virtual machines (EC2)
* Your container images (ECR)
* Your serverless functions (Lambda)

If it’s turned off, you miss out on continuous, automated security checks. This can leave:

* **Unpatched software** on your EC2 instances
* **Insecure container images** that could be pulled into production
* **Exposed Lambda code** that might contain insecure coding patterns or hidden backdoors

Without these scans, you’re more likely to go into production with vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

### What to do next

| Action | Why it helps | Quick win |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **Enable Amazon Inspector for EC2** | Continuous vulnerability scans on your servers | Go to the Inspector console → *Settings* → enable EC2 scanning |
| **Enable Amazon Inspector for ECR** | Scan every image you push to your registry | In the Inspector console → add ECR repository as a target |
| **Enable Lambda code scanning** | Detect insecure code patterns before deployment | Enable *Lambda code scanning* in Inspector settings |
| **Enable Lambda standard scanning** | Catch missing IAM permissions, insecure environment variables, etc. | Same as above – toggle the setting in Inspector |
| **Automate the checks** | Ensure every new image or function goes through Inspector | Set up IAM policies that require Inspector scans before a Lambda can be deployed |
| **Review results** | After enabling, check the Inspector findings and remediate any high‑severity issues | Inspect the Inspector dashboard for “high” findings |

If you’re not familiar with the Inspector UI, AWS has a quick‑start guide that walks you through each of these steps. Once enabled, Inspector will run scans automatically and send you alerts whenever a new vulnerability appears.

### Bottom line

The scan ran fine, but it found that you haven’t turned on Amazon Inspector for any of the main AWS services you’re using. Turning it on will give you continuous, automated visibility into vulnerabilities and help you stay compliant with security best practices. 🚀
