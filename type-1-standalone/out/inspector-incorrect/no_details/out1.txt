## Quick‑Take Summary

- **Probe ran fine** – the tool finished without crashing (“The probe executed successfully!”).
- **No scans were actually performed** – all four checks that look for Amazon Inspector enabled scanning failed.
- **Result** – 0 out of 4 security‑scanning services are on, so you have no automated visibility into vulnerabilities in your EC2, ECR, or Lambda code.

### What the report is telling you

| Check | Status | What it means |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| Amazon Inspector EC2 scanning | **Not enabled** | The tool that automatically looks for problems on your EC2 instances is turned off. |
| Amazon Inspector ECR scanning | **Not enabled** | Docker images you store in Amazon ECR are not being scanned for security issues. |
| Amazon Inspector Lambda code scanning | **Not enabled** | New or updated Lambda functions are not being checked for known code‑level vulnerabilities. |
| Amazon Inspector Lambda standard scanning | **Not enabled** | The more thorough “standard” scanning of Lambda code is also off. |

Because none of these scanners are active, the report didn’t find any CVEs or other weaknesses – it simply tells you that the safeguards you might expect are missing.

### Why this matters

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Undetected vulnerabilities** | A hacker could exploit an unpatched EC2 instance, an insecure image, or a malicious Lambda function. |
| **Compliance gaps** | Many industry standards (PCI‑DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2, etc.) require automated scanning of your environment. |
| **Audit visibility** | When auditors ask how you keep your code and containers safe, you’ll need proof that scans are running. |

### Simple next‑steps

1. **Turn on Amazon Inspector scanning**  
   * Go to the Inspector console in the AWS Management Console.  
   * For each service (EC2, ECR, Lambda), enable the default rules package and schedule scans.

2. **Automate the scans**  
   * Use AWS CloudWatch Events or EventBridge to trigger Inspector every time you launch an EC2 instance, push a new image, or deploy a Lambda update.

3. **Review scan results**  
   * Once enabled, Inspector will generate findings. Review them in the console or export to an SIEM for continuous monitoring.

4. **Document the change**  
   * Update your security policies and compliance documentation to show that these scans are active and regularly reviewed.

### Bottom line

The probe ran, but your AWS environment lacks the automated security scanning that Amazon Inspector provides. Enabling these scans is a quick and effective way to keep an eye on new vulnerabilities and satisfy many compliance requirements. If you enable them, the next time the probe runs you’ll see a positive result (“n/4 succeeded”) and real vulnerability data instead of “0/4 succeeded.”
