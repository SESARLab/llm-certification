The assessment found three main risks:  
1. Out‑of‑date software that could be attacked.  
2. Weak passwords that make unauthorized access easy.  
3. A phishing vulnerability that could trick users into revealing sensitive data.  

Updating the software, strengthening passwords, and training staff will greatly lower the chance of a breach.
