The scan ran, but none of the checks passed – all four security tests failed. That means your Amazon services (EC2, ECR, and both Lambda scanning types) aren’t actively scanning for vulnerabilities. As a result, potential security gaps aren’t being detected. Enable Amazon Inspector for each of these services so your environment can be monitored and protected automatically.
