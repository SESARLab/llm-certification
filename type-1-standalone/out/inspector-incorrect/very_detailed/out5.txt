The probe found that none of the four Amazon Inspector scans (for EC2, ECR, and Lambda code/standard) are enabled. Without these scans, hidden security flaws may go undetected, letting attackers exploit vulnerabilities, steal data, or disrupt services. Enabling Inspector will help detect and fix weaknesses before they can be exploited—acting now protects your AWS environment.
