The check found that four security scans are turned off in your AWS account.  
• No automated scan of your EC2 servers.  
• No scan of your container images.  
• No scan of your Lambda functions’ code.  
• No scan of your Lambda functions’ runtime environment.  

Because these checks are missing, hidden software flaws, malware or misconfigurations could go unnoticed and expose your applications to attackers or data loss. Turning them on would help catch and fix such risks early.
