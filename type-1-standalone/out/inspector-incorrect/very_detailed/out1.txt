The test found that all four Amazon Inspector scans are disabled. Inspector automatically checks your EC2 servers, container images, and Lambda code for known bugs and security gaps. With these scans off, any vulnerabilities in your software or infrastructure could go unnoticed, letting attackers gain access, steal data, or disrupt services. Enabling Inspector will give you an early warning of these weaknesses and help keep your cloud environment safe.
