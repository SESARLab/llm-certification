The scan ran fine, but it found that all Amazon Inspector security checks are turned off: no scanning for EC2 servers, container images (ECR), or Lambda code.  
Without these scans, hidden software bugs, malware, or unpatched vulnerabilities could go unnoticed, letting attackers exploit your applications or violate compliance rules. Enabling Inspector will automatically check for such weaknesses and help keep your AWS resources safer.
