The probe found that none of the Amazon Inspector scans—EC2, ECR, and both Lambda code and standard—are turned on. Without these automated checks, your servers, containers, and serverless functions can hide malware, misconfigurations, or vulnerable code. That means attackers could exploit weaknesses before you notice, putting data and services at risk. Enabling Inspector is recommended to detect and mitigate these threats early.
