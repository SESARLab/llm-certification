The security scan found **no automated vulnerability checks** are running in your AWS environment. All four checks (EC2, ECR, and Lambda code/standard scans) are disabled.  

Without these scans, malware, insecure code, or exposed secrets can go unnoticed, increasing the risk of data breaches, service outages, or exploitation by attackers. Enabling the scans will help catch and fix these weaknesses before they can be abused.
