The probe ran fine but found that none of the four AWS security checks passed. All Amazon Inspector scans (EC2, ECR, Lambda code, and Lambda standard) are disabled, so your servers, container images, and Lambda functions aren’t being automatically checked for known bugs or bad code. This leaves your applications vulnerable to malware, data leaks, or other security breaches that would otherwise be caught by these scans.
