The probe found that none of the four Amazon Inspector checks passed—EC2, ECR, and both Lambda scanning options are disabled. Inspector normally scans for known security problems in servers, container images, and Lambda code. With it off, you have no early warning of vulnerabilities, leaving your applications and data exposed to attackers. Enabling Inspector would let you detect and fix issues before they can be exploited.
