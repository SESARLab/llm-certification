The probe ran fine but found a problem with your encryption keys. Out of 7 keys, 2 have key‑rotation turned off. This means those keys could stay the same for a long time, making it easier for attackers to reuse or guess them if they ever get a hold. If a key is compromised, the data it protects could be read or tampered with, increasing the risk of a security breach.
