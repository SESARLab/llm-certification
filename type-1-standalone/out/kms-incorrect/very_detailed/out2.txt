The security check ran but found a problem: 2 of your 7 encryption keys are not set to rotate automatically. If these keys are ever stolen, an attacker could decrypt all data encrypted with them for a long time. Regular key rotation limits how long a stolen key is useful and is a best‑practice requirement. Fixing this will strengthen protection of your applications and data.
