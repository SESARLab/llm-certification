The security test found a problem: 2 of 7 encryption keys in your AWS account are not set to rotate automatically. If an attacker gets hold of one of those keys, they could keep using it for a long time to read or tamper with your data. This increases the risk of data leaks, unauthorized access, and makes it harder to recover if a key is compromised. Fixing the rotation will help protect your applications and data.
