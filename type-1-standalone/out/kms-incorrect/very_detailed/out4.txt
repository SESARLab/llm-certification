The test ran fine but found a problem: 2 of 7 encryption keys in AWS Key Management Service are not set to rotate automatically. If an attacker obtains one of those keys, it could stay valid forever, letting them read or tamper with your encrypted data. Rotating keys regularly limits exposure and keeps your data safer.
