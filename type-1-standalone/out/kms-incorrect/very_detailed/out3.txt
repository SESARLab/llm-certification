The probe ran and found a security problem: 2 out of 7 AWS encryption keys won’t rotate automatically. If those keys are ever compromised, attackers could keep using them forever. Automatic key rotation limits damage, so the missing rotation puts your data at higher risk. Fixing this keeps your encryption more secure and protects your applications.
