The probe ran and found 2 of 7 encryption keys that never change, making them vulnerable to long‑term theft. If an attacker gets one of those keys, they could read or forge data for months. The other 5 keys rotate correctly, which is good. To secure your environment, rotate the two non‑compliant keys promptly.
