**Quick‑look summary**

| Item | What it means |
|------|---------------|
| **Probe ran fine** | The test finished without errors – “The probe executed successfully!” |
| **Overall result** | “0/1 succeeded” – the only test ran, and it did not pass. |
| **Key‑rotation check (CIS KMS.4)** | 7 encryption keys were examined. 5 of them rotate automatically (good). 2 of them don’t rotate (bad). |

### What does this mean?

- **CIS KMS.4** is a security rule that says “every key in your Key Management Service (KMS) should automatically rotate at a set interval.”  
- In this assessment, the tool looked at all 7 keys you have in your KMS.
- It found that **keyId6** and **keyId7** are **not** configured to rotate.  

### Why is that a problem?

- If a key is never rotated, an attacker who compromises that key could keep using it indefinitely.  
- Rotation limits the amount of data that could be compromised if a key leaks.

### What should you do next?

1. **Enable automatic rotation** for keyId6 and keyId7.  
   *In most cloud providers you can simply toggle “auto‑rotate” in the key settings.*  
2. **Verify** that the change is reflected by running the probe again.  
3. Keep an eye on any new keys you create to ensure they start with rotation enabled.

### Bonus: CVEs

- The report had an empty CVE list, so no known software vulnerabilities were found in this assessment.

**Bottom line:**  
The scan ran fine but uncovered two keys that don’t rotate. Turn on rotation for those keys to meet best‑practice security standards.
