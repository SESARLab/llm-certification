**What the report is telling you (in plain English)**  

| Item | What it means | Why it matters |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| **Probe executed successfully** | The security tool ran without crashing. | Good – the results are trustworthy. |
| **Summary: “0/1 succeeded”** | Out of the single check it performed, none passed. | The system still has a security issue. |
| **CIS KMS.4 check** | Looks at how your cloud‑based key‑management system (KMS) handles key rotation. | Automatic key rotation is a best practice that limits how long a key can be used – if a key isn’t rotated it can stay in use for too long, raising the risk of a breach. |
| **Result: “2 out of 7 keys found with rotation disabled”** | 7 encryption keys were found; 5 of them have rotation enabled (good), but 2 do not (bad). | Those 2 keys could be compromised for an extended period because they won’t be automatically rotated. |
| **Non‑compliant keys** | `keyId6` and `keyId7` | These are the ones that need action. |
| **Compliant keys** | `keyId1` – `keyId5` | These are already set up correctly. |
| **CVE list** | Empty | No known public vulnerabilities were detected. |

### Bottom‑line:  
The assessment ran fine, but it found a security gap: **two of your encryption keys (`keyId6` and `keyId7`) don’t have automatic rotation turned on.** If an attacker gets hold of one of those keys, it could stay valid longer than it should.

### What to do next  

1. **Enable automatic rotation for `keyId6` and `keyId7`** – most cloud KMS platforms let you set a rotation interval (e.g., every 90 days).  
2. **Verify that the rotation policy is enforced** – run the probe again or check your KMS dashboard.  
3. **Document the change** – update your security policies to reflect the new rotation settings.  

Once those two keys are fixed, the CIS KMS.4 check will pass and your encryption posture will be stronger.
