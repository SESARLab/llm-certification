**What the report is telling us – in plain language**

| What you’re looking at | What it means |
|------------------------|---------------|
| **Probe ran without crashing** | The tool you used to check your security (the “probe”) finished without errors – that’s the “The probe executed successfully!” line. |
| **Summary: “0/1 succeeded”** | One check was run (the CIS KMS.4 test).  It didn’t pass – that’s why the summary shows 0 successes out of 1 test. |
| **CIS KMS.4 – “Key Management – Rotation”** | This rule says every key used in your Key Management Service (KMS) should have automatic rotation turned on.  If it’s off, the key can stay in use forever, which is a risk. |
| **Result: “2 out of 7 keys found with rotation disabled”** | Out of the 7 keys you have, 5 are following the rule (they rotate).  2 are not. |
| **Compliant keys** | `keyId1`, `keyId2`, `keyId3`, `keyId4`, `keyId5` – these are safe because they rotate. |
| **Non‑compliant keys** | `keyId6` and `keyId7` – these are the ones that need your attention. |
| **No CVEs** | The assessment didn’t flag any known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) for your environment. |

### Bottom line

- The security check ran fine, but it found a problem: **two of your seven KMS keys (`keyId6` and `keyId7`) have key rotation disabled**.  
- To improve security, enable rotation on those two keys so they can’t be used indefinitely.  

Once you fix those two keys, the CIS KMS.4 test should pass. If you need help turning rotation on, let me know!
