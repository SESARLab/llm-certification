### What the assessment did

- **Probe status** – The automated check ran without any errors.  
  - *Result:* “The probe executed successfully!”  
  - *Overall outcome:* 0/1 succeeded (i.e., the single check it performed didn’t fully pass).

- **Key‑management focus** – The check looked at the rotation settings for your cloud encryption keys.

### Key findings

| Item | Finding | What it means |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **CIS KMS.4** | 2 out of 7 keys have rotation **disabled** | Your key‑management system is supposed to rotate keys automatically (the “CIS” benchmark). Two of your keys aren’t set up to rotate, which can leave them vulnerable if compromised. |

**Compliant keys** (rotation enabled):  
- keyId1  
- keyId2  
- keyId3  
- keyId4  
- keyId5  

**Non‑compliant keys** (rotation disabled):  
- keyId6  
- keyId7  

### Why it matters

- **Rotation protects against exposure** – If a key is compromised, a rotated key can limit the damage to a short window.  
- **Compliance** – Many security frameworks (e.g., CIS) require regular key rotation. Non‑compliance can trigger audit or regulatory flags.

### Next steps

1. **Enable rotation** on keyId6 and keyId7 as soon as possible.  
   - In most cloud providers, this is a simple toggle in the key settings.  
2. **Verify that rotation works** – After enabling, check that new key versions are being generated automatically.  
3. **Document the change** – Record the configuration change and update your security policy so future audits show compliance.

### Bottom line

- The scan ran fine.  
- Two of your seven keys are missing the critical rotation feature, which is a security gap. Fixing this will bring you into line with recommended best practices.
