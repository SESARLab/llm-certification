All 13 security checks passed, meaning the AWS environment is set up correctly. Every user has strong passwords, MFA, and their access keys are rotated every 90 days. The root account has no keys and uses hardware MFA. No unnecessary permissions or outdated certificates exist. The system also monitors for external access and has a support role in place. In short, there’s no immediate security risk from configuration errors.
