All 13 checks in your AWS environment passed.  
• No root‑user keys exist, and MFA (hardware + software) protects the root and all users.  
• User passwords are strong (≥16 chars) and can't be reused for 24 changes.  
• Access keys rotate every 90 days and are inactive after 45 days.  
• No risky policies or old certificates exist.  

In short, your account is well‑locked down and unlikely to be compromised by mis‑configured IAM settings.
