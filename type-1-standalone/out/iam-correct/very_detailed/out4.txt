The probe checked 13 security rules for your AWS account. All tests passed: users have strong passwords, MFA, and rotating keys; no root keys exist; and no overly‑permissive policies are attached. This means the biggest risks—unauthorized access, credential theft, or data exposure—are currently mitigated. If any rule had failed, attackers could have gained easier entry or kept credentials longer, potentially compromising your applications.
