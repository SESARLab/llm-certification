The probe checked 13 key security areas in your AWS environment and found every control in place. No root key is active, all users have MFA and passwords meet a 16‑character minimum, keys are rotated every 90 days, and no unused or overly‑permissive policies exist. Server certificates are valid, a support role is present, and external access is monitored. In short, your apps face low risk from common misconfigurations.
