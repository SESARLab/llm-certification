The security scan ran without errors and checked 13 key settings in your AWS account. All of them passed – no root access keys, MFA is enabled everywhere, passwords are strong (≥16 chars), access keys rotate every 90 days, and no risky policies are attached. In short, your IAM configuration is solid, so the likelihood of a security breach from these settings is very low.
