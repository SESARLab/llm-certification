Your cloud security scan found no problems. All users have strong passwords, MFA, and rotating keys. No root account keys exist, and a support role is set up. Policies that could give too much access (like CloudShell full access) are absent. External access analysis is enabled to spot any public exposure. In short, the environment meets best‑practice controls, so your applications are currently well protected against common credential‑based attacks.
