The assessment checked 13 security rules in your AWS account and found **all of them passing**.  

- Everyone’s login is protected with MFA, and the root account has hardware MFA.  
- Passwords are long (≥16) and can’t be reused for a year.  
- All user keys are rotated within 90 days and inactive for 45 days.  
- No root access keys exist, and no over‑privileged policies are attached.  

In short, your IAM configuration is strong and unlikely to be compromised by the common mistakes the probe checks for.
