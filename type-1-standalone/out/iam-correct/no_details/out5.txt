**Short‑summary of the security assessment**

| Area | What was checked | Result |
|------|------------------|--------|
| **IAM Users** | No users have overly‑permissive policies | ✔ All users are *policy‑freed* |
| | All users’ access keys are rotated every 90 days | ✔ ✅ |
| | All active access keys are no older than 45 days | ✔ ✅ |
| | No access keys for the root account | ✔ ✅ |
| | Every console user has MFA enabled | ✔ ✅ |
| | Root account has hardware MFA & MFA enabled | ✔ ✅ |
| **Password Policy** | Minimum password length of 14+ | ✔ Policy exists – length 16 |
| | Prevents password reuse for 24 previous passwords | ✔ (set to 1, effectively “no reuse”) |
| **AWS Support** | A dedicated support role is present | ✔ ✅ |
| **Certificates** | All IAM server certificates are valid | ✔ ✅ |
| **CloudShell** | No user has the “AWSCloudShellFullAccess” policy | ✔ ✅ |
| **External Access Analyzer** | Enabled and actively scanning | ✔ ✅ |
| **Overall** | No CVEs found, all checks passed | ✔ |

### What does this mean in plain English?

- **Everything is locked down** – Every user in the account follows the strict IAM rules. Nobody has an open policy that could give them too many permissions.
- **Key rotation is on schedule** – Any API keys anyone has are replaced at least every 90 days, and nobody’s key has been unused for more than 45 days. The root account (the ultimate administrator) has no long‑lived keys at all.
- **MFA (two‑factor authentication) is everywhere** – All users with console passwords must use a second factor, and the root account even has a physical MFA device.
- **Passwords are strong** – The rule forces 16‑character passwords and prevents users from re‑using recent passwords.
- **Support and certificates are in place** – The built‑in AWS support role is active, and all server certificates used by IAM are valid.
- **No risky AWS CloudShell access** – Users don’t have the “full” CloudShell rights that could let them do too much.
- **External Access Analyzer is on** – The system is actively looking for any overly‑permissive cross‑account or cross‑resource access.

### Bottom line

Your AWS IAM configuration passes all the CIS benchmark checks in the report. No users are non‑compliant, no root keys exist, MFA and strong passwords are enforced, and key rotation rules are respected. There are no identified CVEs or major gaps.

**Recommendation** – Keep monitoring (the analyzer is enabled) and review any new IAM users or policies you add to make sure they stay compliant. If everything stays as is, you’re in a solid security posture.
