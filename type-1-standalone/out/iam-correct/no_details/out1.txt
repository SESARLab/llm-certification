**Security Assessment – Quick Take**

- **All 13 tests succeeded** – the probe ran without errors and every control checked out.  
- **IAM users are well‑protected**  
  * Everyone (cct, kevin.pease, sqs‑user‑cis‑aws) has no overly permissive policies.  
  * All access keys are rotated every 90 days and none of them have been idle for more than 45 days.  
  * No root user access keys exist.  
  * MFA (both hardware and software) is enabled for the root user and for all console‑password users.  
- **Password policy is strong** – minimum length 16, password reuse prevented.  
- **Support role present** – the AWS Support Service role exists and is correctly configured.  
- **Certificates and permissions** – all server certificates are valid; no user has the risky “AWSCloudShellFullAccess” policy attached.  
- **Visibility into access** – External Access Analyzer is enabled, giving the team insight into cross‑account or public access.

**Bottom line:** Your AWS IAM configuration meets the CIS benchmark standards with no findings. Great job keeping the environment secure!
