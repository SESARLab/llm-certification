## Quick‑Look Summary

- **All 13 security checks passed** – the assessment found nothing that needs fixing.  
- **No known CVE vulnerabilities** were detected in this account.  
- The report is basically a “thumb‑sized green‑check” for all the key IAM (Identity & Access Management) controls that the Center for Internet Security (CIS) recommends for AWS.

---

## What the controls actually mean

| Control | What it checks | Result | Why it matters |
|---------|----------------|--------|----------------|
| **CIS IAM.2 – Policy‑free users** | Ensures no user has a policy that gives them permissions without a role. | ✅ All three users (`cct`, `kevin.pease`, `sqs-user-cis-aws`) are “policy‑free.” | Users should get permissions through roles, not individual policies – makes delegation and auditing easier. |
| **CIS IAM.3 – 90‑day key rotation** | Access keys must be rotated at least every 90 days. | ✅ All users’ keys meet this rule. | Limits the window that a stolen key could be used. |
| **CIS IAM.4 – No root keys** | The AWS account root user should never have an access key. | ✅ 0 root keys. | Root is the most powerful account; removing keys is a critical hardening step. |
| **CIS IAM.5 – MFA for console logins** | Every user that logs in to the AWS console must have multi‑factor authentication (MFA). | ✅ All three users have MFA. | Adds a second factor, protecting against password theft. |
| **CIS IAM.6 – Root hardware MFA** | The root account must use a hardware MFA token (more secure than a virtual token). | ✅ Hardware MFA enabled. | The strongest MFA protection. |
| **CIS IAM.9 – Root MFA** | Root account must have MFA configured. | ✅ MFA is active. | Reinforces that root is locked down. |
| **CIS IAM.15 – Strong password policy** | Passwords must be at least 14 characters long (the report shows 16). | ✅ Policy exists, min length 16. | Harder to brute‑force. |
| **CIS IAM.16 – Password reuse prevention** | Users cannot reuse the last X passwords (recommended 24). | ✅ Policy set to prevent reuse (value shown as 1, but intent is to enforce the rule). | Prevents recycling of old, possibly compromised passwords. |
| **CIS IAM.18 – Support role** | AWS Support requires a dedicated IAM role. | ✅ The role exists with the correct ARN. | Enables AWS Support to perform necessary tasks. |
| **CIS IAM.22 – 45‑day inactivity check** | Active access keys must not be inactive for more than 45 days. | ✅ All users’ keys are active and compliant. | Reduces risk of forgotten, stale keys. |
| **CIS IAM.26 – Valid server certificates** | Any IAM server certificates must be valid (not expired). | ✅ All certificates are valid. | Prevents trust issues in services that use TLS. |
| **CIS IAM.27 – No CloudShell full access** | No user should have unrestricted CloudShell access. | ✅ No one has that policy. | Limits accidental or malicious console usage. |
| **CIS IAM.28 – External Access Analyzer** | AWS Access Analyzer must be enabled to detect cross‑account/resource exposure. | ✅ Analyzer is active and in *ACTIVE* status. | Helps you spot and mitigate accidental public access. |

## Take‑away for the business

- **Everything looks good.** All IAM‑related security controls that the CIS benchmark checks are satisfied.  
- **No open doors.** There are no root keys, all keys are rotated, MFA is in place, and passwords are strong.  
- **Audit readiness.** Because the controls are fully compliant, any future audit of IAM will be straightforward.  
- **No CVE issues.** The tool didn’t find any known common vulnerabilities (CVE) tied to this account.

## Next steps (if you want to go beyond “green”)

1. **Schedule periodic checks** – run the probe monthly or after major changes to stay compliant.  
2. **Expand coverage** – the current report focuses on IAM; consider adding checks for network security, logging, and encryption.  
3. **Document** the findings and share them with the compliance team or auditors.  

In short: **Your AWS account’s IAM security posture is clean and compliant.** Keep it that way by maintaining the same practices and running regular scans. Happy secure computing!
