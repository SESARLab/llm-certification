**Quick‑look Summary**

| Item | What was checked | Result |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| **Overall scan** | 13 CIS I AM control checks | ✔ All 13 passed (13/13) |
| **Root user** | No access keys, MFA (software & hardware) | ✔ |
| **IAM users** | No excess policies, good key rotation, MFA on console, strong password policy, no “cloudshell” policy | ✔ |
| **Support role & Access Analyzer** | Support role present, External Access Analyzer turned on | ✔ |

**What this means in plain English**

- **No vulnerabilities found** – The scanner found nothing that could be easily exploited.  
- **Users are set up correctly** – Every user in the account has only the permissions they really need, their passwords are strong, and they use MFA (a second factor of authentication).  
- **Access keys are safe** – All access keys are rotated every 90 days and none of the keys have been idle for longer than 45 days.  
- **Root account is locked down** – The root account has no secret keys, has MFA enabled (even hardware MFA), so it can’t be hijacked easily.  
- **Strong password policy** – Passwords must be at least 16 characters long and can’t be reused for 24 passwords.  
- **Support role exists** – AWS Support can do what it needs without giving users extra permissions.  
- **External Access Analyzer** – AWS automatically checks whether any of your resources are exposed outside the account, and that feature is turned on.

**Why it matters**

- **Least‑privilege**: By removing unused permissions you reduce the attack surface.  
- **MFA**: Adds a second step to login, making it harder for attackers to break in even if they know a password.  
- **Key rotation & inactivity**: Stale keys are a common target; rotating them limits how long a compromised key can be used.  
- **Strong password policy**: Long, unique passwords are far harder to crack.  
- **Automated monitoring**: The Access Analyzer keeps an eye on accidental exposure.

**Next steps (optional)**

- Continue to review IAM policies on a regular basis – every 3–6 months is a good cadence.  
- Keep an eye on the Access Analyzer reports; if it flags any risky resources, investigate and tighten permissions.  
- Store your MFA devices (e.g., a physical token) in a secure place, and keep backup codes for recovery.

**Bottom line** – Your account is in a very healthy security state according to the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark. Keep the same practices and you’ll stay protected.
