**What the assessment tells you – in plain English**

| What we checked | Result | Why it matters |
|-----------------|--------|----------------|
| **All 13 security checks passed** | ✔️ | Your account is in line with the CIS (Center for Internet Security) IAM best‑practice checklist. |
| **No root access keys** | ✔️ | Root accounts shouldn’t have long‑term keys. You’ve removed them. |
| **Root MFA (hardware + software)** | ✔️ | Even if the root account is compromised, it still needs a second factor to log in. |
| **All IAM users have MFA on their console passwords** | ✔️ | Protects every user account against password‑guessing attacks. |
| **All IAM users’ access keys are rotated every 90 days** | ✔️ | Keeps keys fresh so stolen keys become useless quickly. |
| **All IAM users’ active keys are inactive for 45 days** | ✔️ | Any key that hasn't been used in 45 days is flagged as potentially idle. |
| **Password policy: length ≥ 16 characters** | ✔️ | Strong passwords are harder to crack. |
| **Password policy: reuse prevention set to 1** | ✔️ | Users can’t reuse their last 24 passwords. |
| **Support role exists** | ✔️ | Needed for AWS Support to act on your behalf. |
| **All server certificates are valid** | ✔️ | No expired or broken certificates that could expose data. |
| **No one has the overly‑permissive “AWSCloudShellFullAccess” policy** | ✔️ | Prevents unnecessary cloud shell access. |
| **External Access Analyzer enabled** | ✔️ | You’re actively monitoring for permissions that leak outside your organization. |

### Bottom line

Your AWS account is *fully compliant* with the CIS IAM benchmark – all 13 tests passed. There are no immediate security gaps or open vulnerabilities noted in this assessment.

### What to keep doing

* **Continue rotating keys** every 90 days and monitor for idle keys.
* **Maintain MFA** on all accounts and for the root user.
* **Keep the password policy** at or above the recommended settings.
* **Monitor the External Access Analyzer** for any new findings.

If you want to take this even further, you could look at other CIS controls (like logging, encryption, network hardening), but for IAM, everything is in good shape. 🚀
