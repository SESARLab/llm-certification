Your security scan finished with a clean bill of health. All 13 tests passed, meaning every user and account is following best‑practice rules: passwords are strong, MFA is on, access keys rotate on schedule, the root account has no keys and uses hardware MFA, and no risky permissions exist. In short, your account is correctly configured and shows no vulnerabilities. No action needed.
