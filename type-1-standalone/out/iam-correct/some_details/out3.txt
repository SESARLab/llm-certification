The security check finished without problems. All 13 tests passed. User accounts have strong passwords, MFA on both normal and root accounts, keys are rotated every 90 days, no root key exists, permissions are tight, and support roles and certificates are set up correctly. The system is compliant with the CIS IAM guidelines, meaning your account is protected against common configuration mistakes.
