The security scan ran without errors and found no problems – all 13 checks passed. Every user account has strong passwords, MFA (including the root account), up‑to‑date access keys, and no unnecessary permissions. Passwords are long, rarely reused, and inactive keys are rotated. The system also has a support role and an external access analyzer enabled. In short, your AWS account is secure and compliant.
