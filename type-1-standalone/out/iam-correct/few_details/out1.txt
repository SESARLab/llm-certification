Your security scan found everything in good shape. All 13 checks passed, meaning user accounts follow strong rules: passwords are at least 16 characters, MFA is on for everyone (including the root), no root keys exist, and access keys are rotated every 90 days. The account has a support role, no risky policies attached, and external access analysis is active. In short, your IAM settings are secure and compliant.
