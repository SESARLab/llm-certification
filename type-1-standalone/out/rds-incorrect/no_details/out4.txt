**Quick‑Take Summary**

- **What was tested?**  
  The audit looked at the security settings of your Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) database instance.

- **How did it go?**  
  Out of three recommended checks (CIS RDS.2, CIS RDS.3, CIS RDS.13), **two succeeded** and **one failed**.

| Check | Result | Why it matters |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| **CIS RDS.2 – Publicly accessible instances** | **Failed** | 1 of 2 RDS instances is exposed to the public internet. That makes it easier for attackers to try to log in or perform other malicious actions. |
| **CIS RDS.3 – Encryption at rest** | **Passed** | The database’s data is encrypted on disk – a good baseline security practice. |
| **CIS RDS.13 – Auto‑minor‑version upgrade** | **Passed** | Automatic minor version upgrades keep the database patched against known bugs and security fixes. |

- **No known CVEs** were found (the “cve” list is empty).

### What should you do next?

1. **Restrict public access**  
   - Move the database into a private subnet (inside your VPC) or at least remove the public IP address.  
   - Use security groups to allow inbound traffic only from trusted IPs or from your application servers.

2. **Review other security settings**  
   - Even though encryption and auto‑upgrade passed, double‑check that backups, IAM roles, and parameter groups follow your organization’s policies.

3. **Document and remediate**  
   - Create a ticket to fix the public‑access issue.  
   - Add the fix to your security checklist so it’s covered in future audits.

### Bottom line

Your database is mostly secure: it’s encrypted and stays automatically patched. The only real risk is that one instance is reachable from the internet. Fix that, and you’ll meet the CIS RDS security baseline.
