**What the assessment looked at**

The probe checked three *CIS* (Center for Internet Security) rules for Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) databases:

| Rule | What it checks | Result |
|------|----------------|--------|
| **CIS‑RDS.2** | Are any RDS instances exposed to the public internet? | ❌ **Fail** – 1 of 2 databases can be reached from anywhere. The instance is called **database‑1**. |
| **CIS‑RDS.3** | Are all databases encrypted at rest? | ✅ **Pass** – the database that was checked (database‑1) is encrypted. |
| **CIS‑RDS.13** | Are auto‑minor‑version upgrades enabled? | ✅ **Pass** – database‑1 has auto‑upgrade turned on. |

The probe ran without errors (the “pretty_result” says *“The probe executed successfully!”*), so the results are reliable.

### What does this mean in plain English?

1. **One database is publicly exposed** – Anyone on the internet could potentially connect to it, unless they know the exact login credentials.  
2. **The data in that database is encrypted on disk** – That’s good; it protects the data if someone steals the underlying storage.  
3. **Automatic patching is enabled** – The database will automatically apply small, non‑disruptive updates, keeping it up‑to‑date with the vendor.

### Why is the public exposure a risk?

- **Unauthorized access** – If an attacker guesses the login or exploits a vulnerability, they can read, modify, or delete data.
- **Compliance** – Many regulations (e.g., PCI, HIPAA) require that databases not be publicly accessible unless absolutely necessary.
- **Side‑channel attacks** – Even if the login fails, an exposed instance can be used for reconnaissance or to amplify other attacks.

### Quick actions to fix the problem

| Step | What to do | Why |
|------|------------|-----|
| 1. **Restrict inbound traffic** | Change the database’s security group to allow connections only from trusted IP ranges (e.g., your office or a bastion host). | Limits who can reach the database. |
| 2. **Use a bastion host / VPN** | If you need to manage the database from outside the VPC, set up a secure jump box or VPN instead of opening it to the internet. | Adds an extra layer of protection. |
| 3. **Confirm encryption** | Verify that *all* RDS instances (including the other one that isn’t listed in the pass‑list) are also encrypted. | Consistent protection across the environment. |
| 4. **Keep auto‑upgrade on** | Since the probe found this already good, keep it enabled. | Ensures future minor patches are applied automatically. |

### Bottom line

- **Good news**: Your database is encrypted and stays patched automatically.  
- **Area to improve**: Close the public exposure of `database‑1`. Once that’s fixed, the assessment will show 3/3 passed, and the environment will be much more secure.
