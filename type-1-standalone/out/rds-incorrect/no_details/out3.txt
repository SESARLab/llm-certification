**What the report is telling you (in plain English)**  

| Check | What it looks at | Result | What it means |
|-------|------------------|--------|---------------|
| **CIS RDS.2 – Publicly‑accessible instances** | Are any of your Amazon RDS databases open to the Internet? | **Fail** – 1 of 2 databases can be reached from anywhere. | *Danger*: Anyone on the Internet could try to connect to that database, which is a big security risk. |
| **CIS RDS.3 – Encryption at rest** | Is every database encrypted on disk? | **Pass** – The one database that is being inspected is encrypted. | *Good*: Data is protected if the storage media is stolen. |
| **CIS RDS.13 – Auto minor‑version upgrade** | Will the database automatically receive small (non‑breaking) updates? | **Pass** – Auto‑upgrade is enabled. | *Good*: The database will stay up‑to‑date without manual intervention. |

**Summary**

- The probe ran fine – “The probe executed successfully!”  
- Out of the 3 checks the scanner performed, 2 passed and 1 failed (2/3 succeeded).  
- No known CVE vulnerabilities were found.

**What you should do next**

1. **Fix the public access issue (CIS RDS.2).**  
   * Identify why `database-1` is exposed.  
   * Tighten its security group so that only trusted IP addresses or VPC subnets can reach it.  
   * If the database really needs to be public (rare), at least restrict the ports, use IAM authentication, and enable encryption‑in‑transit.  

2. **Review other databases.**  
   The report only mentioned one instance (`database-1`). If you have more RDS instances, run the same scan again to ensure none of them are also publicly exposed.  

3. **Maintain the “good” settings.**  
   * Encryption at rest is already enabled – keep it.  
   * Auto‑minor‑version upgrade is on – keep it on to stay current.  

**Bottom line**

You have a serious security issue with one database that is publicly accessible. Fix that right away. All the other assessed security controls are already in place, so you’re on the right track.
