**Security Assessment – Quick Take**

| Item | Result | What it means | Next step |
|------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **Overall probe** | ✅ “The probe executed successfully!” | The scanner ran without errors. | Great – you can trust the findings. |
| **CIS RDS.2 – Publicly‑accessible databases** | ❌ “1 out of 2 RDS instances are publicly accessible” | One of your two Amazon RDS databases (`database‑1`) can be reached from the internet. Anyone with the right credentials could log in, which is a high‑risk exposure. | Move the instance into a VPC, enable a security group that only allows traffic from trusted IP ranges, or use a bastion host. |
| **CIS RDS.3 – Encryption** | ✅ “All 1 RDS instances are encrypted” | All databases are encrypted at rest (good practice). | Keep it enabled and check that encryption keys are rotated and managed correctly. |
| **CIS RDS.13 – Auto‑minor‑version upgrades** | ✅ “All 1 RDS instances have auto minor version upgrade enabled” | Your database will automatically receive non‑breaking patch releases (e.g., 12.6 → 12.7). | Monitor upgrade logs and confirm that upgrades do not affect application compatibility. |

### Bottom line
- **Successes**: Encryption and auto‑upgrade are on point.  
- **Weakness**: One database is publicly exposed – treat it as a high‑severity issue.  
- **No CVEs found**: The scan didn’t surface any known vulnerabilities in the software.

### What to do next
1. **Restrict `database-1`** – place it behind a private subnet, adjust the security group, or use a VPN/bastion.  
2. **Document the change** – keep a record of why the change was made and how it was validated.  
3. **Re‑run the scan** after the fix to confirm the issue is resolved.

By fixing the public‑access problem, you’ll bring the overall score from 2/3 to a perfect 3/3, tightening your cloud security posture.
