**What the assessment tells us**

| Check | Result | What it means |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| **CIS RDS.2 – Public access** | ❌ *Failed* | One of your Amazon RDS databases (`database‑1`) is reachable from the Internet. This exposes the database to potential attackers. |
| **CIS RDS.3 – Encryption** | ✅ *Passed* | All of your RDS databases are encrypted at rest, so the data on disk is protected. |
| **CIS RDS.13 – Auto‑upgrade** | ✅ *Passed* | Automatic minor version upgrades are turned on, so the database will get small, non‑breaking updates without manual intervention. |

**Overall**  
The probe ran correctly (“The probe executed successfully!”). Out of the three checks, two passed and one failed – the one that needs your attention is the public‑access issue.

**Next step**  
Restrict network access to `database-1` (e.g., place it in a private subnet, use security groups or VPC endpoints) so that only trusted resources can connect. The other two areas (encryption and auto‑upgrade) are already configured correctly.
