The scan ran fine, but one of your two database servers (database‑1) is open to the public internet. Anyone on the web can try to connect to it, putting your data and applications at risk of theft or attack. The other two checks—encryption and automatic patching—passed, so your data is protected and software stays up‑to‑date. Still, stop public access to keep the database safe.
