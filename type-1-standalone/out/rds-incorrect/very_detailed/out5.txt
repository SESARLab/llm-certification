The security check ran fine and found two of three key checks passed.  
- **Public database**: One of your AWS databases (“database‑1”) is exposed to the internet. Anyone could try to connect to it, risking data theft or unauthorized use.  
- **Encryption & updates**: The same database is encrypted and auto‑updates are enabled, keeping data safe and protecting against software bugs.  

Fix the public access to keep your data secure.
