Your probe ran fine, but it found that one of your database servers is open to the internet. That means anyone could potentially connect to it if they find the address, risking data theft or tampering. The good news: the data is encrypted and the system will automatically update to newer secure versions, which helps keep it protected. Still, you should restrict internet access or move the database behind a firewall to secure it.
