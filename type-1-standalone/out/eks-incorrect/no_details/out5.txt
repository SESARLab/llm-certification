**Quick‑look summary**

| Check | Result | What it means |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| **Overall** | 4/7 controls passed | The probe ran fine, but 3 key security gaps were found. |
| **CIS EKS 2.1.1** | ✅ Passed | Audit logging on the API‑server is turned on. |
| **NIST EKS.1** | ❌ Failed | One cluster (`musa‑dev`) has a *public* endpoint – anyone on the internet can reach it. |
| **NIST EKS.2** | ✅ Passed | The cluster runs a supported Kubernetes version (`1.31`). |
| **NIST EKS.3** | ❌ Failed | Secrets stored in the cluster are **not encrypted** in‑transit or at rest. |
| **NIST EKS.6** | ❌ Failed | The cluster is missing required tags (e.g., `tag1`). |
| **NIST EKS.7** | ✅ Passed | All identity‑provider (IdP) configurations have the required tags. |
| **NIST EKS.8** | ✅ Passed | Audit logging is enabled on all clusters. |

No CVEs were found in this assessment.

### What the probe did

The tool scanned your Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) environment, checked a set of best‑practice controls, and reported which ones succeeded or failed. The “probe executed successfully” message just means the scanner ran to completion; it does **not** guarantee that everything is safe.

### What the failures mean & why they matter

| Control | Why it matters | Practical impact |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| **Public cluster endpoints (NIST EKS.1)** | Exposes the Kubernetes API to the public internet. | Attackers could attempt to brute‑force credentials, discover services, or launch privilege‑escalation attacks. |
| **Unencrypted secrets (NIST EKS.3)** | Kubernetes stores secrets (DB passwords, API keys, etc.) unencrypted unless you enable encryption‑at‑rest. | Anyone who can read the cluster state or compromise a node could read these secrets. |
| **Missing tags (NIST EKS.6)** | Tags are often used for cost tracking, access control, or automated compliance checks. | Lack of tags can make it hard to audit resource ownership or enforce policies. |

---

### Immediate next steps

| Issue | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Public endpoint** | Use a private VPC endpoint, security groups, or a bastion host to restrict access. |
| **Encrypt secrets** | Enable AWS Key Management Service (KMS) encryption for the cluster: `eksctl create cluster --encryption-keys <KMS-ARN>` or edit the cluster’s encryption config. |
| **Add missing tags** | Add the required tag (`tag1`) to the cluster resources, or update the tagging policy in your IaC pipeline. |
| **Verify audit logs** | Review the enabled log types (`api`, `audit`, `authenticator`) to ensure they capture the needed events. |

### Bottom line

- **Good**: Audit logging is on, the cluster version is supported, and IdP configs are correctly tagged.  
- **Needs attention**: Public endpoint, unencrypted secrets, and missing tags.  
- **No known CVEs**: The software itself has no known critical vulnerabilities at the time of the scan.

Fix the highlighted gaps to bring the cluster into full compliance with the NIST/EKS guidelines and to harden it against the most common attack vectors. Once you address those items, run the probe again to confirm the improvements.
