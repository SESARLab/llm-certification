**Security Assessment Summary – Kubernetes (EKS) Cluster “musa‑dev”**

| # | Control | Result | What It Means | Why It Matters | Quick Fix |
|---|---------|--------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| 1 | **CIS EKS 2.1.1 – API‑Server audit logging** | ✅ Passed | Audit logs for every API request are turned on. | Helps detect abuse, investigate incidents, and meet compliance. | None needed. |
| 2 | **NIST EKS.1 – Public cluster endpoints** | ❌ Failed | The cluster’s API endpoint is reachable from the internet. | Exposes the cluster to the public internet, raising the risk of unauthenticated access or brute‑force attacks. | Restrict the endpoint to a private VPC/subnet or use a VPC‑endpoint + security groups. |
| 3 | **NIST EKS.2 – Cluster version supported** | ✅ Passed | Cluster runs Kubernetes 1.31, which is still supported by AWS. | Ensures you receive security patches and bug fixes. | Keep monitoring for new EKS releases; upgrade when needed. |
| 4 | **NIST EKS.3 – Secrets encryption** | ❌ Failed | Kubernetes secrets are stored in plain text (no encryption at rest). | If the underlying storage is compromised, attackers can read secrets (tokens, passwords, etc.). | Enable CMEK (customer‑managed keys) or use the default EKS encryption config. |
| 5 | **NIST EKS.6 – Required tags** | ❌ Failed | The cluster is missing at least one required tag (`tag1`). | Tags help with cost allocation, automation, and compliance reporting. | Add the missing tag(s) to the cluster and any associated resources. |
| 6 | **NIST EKS.7 – IDP config tags** | ✅ Passed | Identity‑Provider (IdP) configurations have all required tags. | Ensures proper governance and auditability of IdP settings. | None needed. |
| 7 | **NIST EKS.8 – Audit logging on all clusters** | ✅ Passed | Audit logging is enabled across the cluster (matching CIS 2.1.1). | Confirms a consistent logging posture. | None needed. |

### Bottom‑Line

- **Probe success** – The security scan ran correctly and produced useful results.  
- **Successes** – 4 of 7 controls passed. Logging and version support are solid.  
- **Critical gaps** –  
  1. The cluster’s API endpoint is public → increase exposure risk.  
  2. Secrets are unencrypted → sensitive data is at risk.  
  3. Missing tags → poor resource management and potential compliance issues.

### Next Steps

1. **Close Public Endpoint**  
   * Use a VPC endpoint or a private subnet for the API server.  
   * Add an ingress control (security group, NACL) to allow only trusted IPs.

2. **Encrypt Secrets**  
   * Enable EKS-managed or customer‑managed encryption for `kubernetes.io/cluster‑secrets`.  
   * Validate with `kubectl get secrets -o yaml` to confirm `type: kubernetes.io/encrypted`.

3. **Tag the Cluster**  
   * Apply `tag1` (and any other required tags) to the cluster and associated IAM roles, security groups, etc.  
   * Use Terraform / CloudFormation to enforce tag policies.

4. **Ongoing Monitoring**  
   * Set up a policy that alerts when a cluster’s endpoint becomes public or when secret encryption is disabled.  
   * Periodically run the same scan (e.g., quarterly) to keep compliance up to date.

By addressing these three high‑impact issues, you’ll move from “4/7” to “7/7” and significantly strengthen the security posture of your EKS environment.
