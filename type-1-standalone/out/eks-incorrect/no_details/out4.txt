**What the report tells you at a glance**

| Item | Result | What it means |
|------|--------|---------------|
| **Probe ran** | ✅ The probe ran without errors. | The assessment finished cleanly. |
| **Controls checked** | 7 total, 4 passed, 3 failed | We looked at 7 security checks. Four were OK, three need work. |
| **No CVEs** | – | The scan didn’t find any known software vulnerabilities. |

### ✅ What’s working

| Control | Cluster | Key point |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **CIS EKS 2.1.1** | `musa-dev` | Audit logs are on for API calls, authentication, and audit events. |
| **NIST EKS.2** | `musa-dev` | The Kubernetes version (1.31) is still supported by AWS. |
| **NIST EKS.7** | `musa-dev` | Any identity‑provider (IDP) configurations have the tags you require. |
| **NIST EKS.8** | `musa-dev` | Audit logging is enabled across the cluster (same log types as CIS 2.1.1). |

**Bottom line:** Logging and version support are solid, and your IDP tags are in place.

### ⚠️ What needs attention

| Control | Issue | Why it matters | Suggested fix |
|---------|-------|----------------|---------------|
| **NIST EKS.1** | Public cluster endpoints | Anyone on the internet can see the API endpoint, increasing exposure to attackers. | Make the endpoint private or place it behind a VPC endpoint / firewall. |
| **NIST EKS.3** | Secrets not encrypted | Kubernetes secrets are stored in plain text on disk; if the node or storage is compromised, secrets are exposed. | Enable `secretsEncryptionConfig` in the cluster (AES‑256 or KMS). |
| **NIST EKS.6** | Missing required tags | Tags help with cost allocation, compliance, and automation. A missing tag (e.g., `tag1`) makes it harder to track or enforce policies. | Add the required tags to the cluster resources. |

### Quick wins

1. **Hide the API endpoint** – Switch from a public endpoint to a VPC‑only endpoint or a private subnet.
2. **Turn on secret encryption** – Use the EKS console or `eksctl` to enable KMS‑based encryption for secrets.
3. **Add missing tags** – Use the AWS console or CLI to tag the cluster (e.g., `tag1=some‑value`).

Once those three items are fixed, the assessment will report **7/7** passing – a clean bill of health for your EKS cluster.
