**Security Assessment Summary – “The probe executed successfully!”**

| Area | What was checked | Result | What it means | Quick fix |
|------|------------------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **Audit logging** | Did the cluster record all API calls? | ✔️ **Passed** (CIS EKS 2.1.1) | All activity is logged, so you can see what happened when. | No action needed. |
| **Cluster visibility** | Are any clusters reachable from the public internet? | ❌ **Failed** (NIST EKS.1) | The “musa‑dev” cluster is exposed to the world. Anyone could try to poke it. | Restrict the cluster’s endpoint to your network or add a firewall rule. |
| **Version support** | Is the Kubernetes version still supported? | ✔️ **Passed** (NIST EKS.2) | “musa‑dev” runs 1.31, which is still supported by AWS. | Keep the cluster up‑to‑date; no action now. |
| **Secret encryption** | Are Kubernetes secrets encrypted at rest? | ❌ **Failed** (NIST EKS.3) | Secrets (e.g., passwords, API keys) are stored in plain text. | Enable encryption‑at‑rest via the cluster’s encryption config. |
| **Tagging** | Do clusters have the required tags (e.g., for cost, ownership)? | ❌ **Failed** (NIST EKS.6) | “musa‑dev” is missing “tag1”. | Add the missing tags; it helps with monitoring and compliance. |
| **Identity‑Provider tags** | Do identity‑provider configs have the required tags? | ✔️ **Passed** (NIST EKS.7) | Tagging is correct for the identity‑provider settings. | No action needed. |
| **Audit logging (again)** | Are all clusters enabled for audit logging? | ✔️ **Passed** (NIST EKS.8) | All clusters are logging; you can see who did what. | No action needed. |

### What does this all mean?

- **4 of 7 tests passed** – the probe ran fine and most of your security controls are in place.
- **Two areas need attention** (public access & secret encryption) plus a tagging issue.  
  *Both are fairly straightforward to fix and are essential for keeping your workloads safe.*

### Next steps

1. **Lock down the public endpoint**  
   * Change the cluster endpoint type to *private* or add a VPC‑endpoint rule that only allows traffic from your internal network.

2. **Enable encryption‑at‑rest for secrets**  
   * In the cluster’s configuration, add an encryption provider (e.g., AWS KMS) so secrets are stored encrypted.

3. **Add the missing tag “tag1”**  
   * Update the cluster’s tags in the AWS console or via `eksctl`/CLI so it matches your tagging policy.

4. **Re‑run the assessment**  
   * After making these changes, run the probe again to confirm the fixes are effective.

### Bottom line

Your cluster is mostly compliant with best‑practice security checks, but the public access and unencrypted secrets are potential risks. Fix those, and you’ll have a robust, well‑logged, and properly tagged Kubernetes environment. 🚀
