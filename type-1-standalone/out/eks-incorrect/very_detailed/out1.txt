The check found that your AWS Kubernetes cluster is visible to the public internet, meaning anyone could try to access it. It also stores secrets (like passwords) in plain text, which could be stolen. Some required labels (tags) are missing, making it hard to manage resources. The good news: the cluster version is current, and all logs are turned on for monitoring. Fixing these gaps will protect data and make compliance easier.
