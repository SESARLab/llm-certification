The assessment scanned your AWS Kubernetes clusters.  
- One cluster (“musa‑dev”) is exposed to the internet, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access.  
- Secrets stored in that cluster aren’t encrypted, so sensitive data could be read if compromised.  
- Missing tags can cause mis‑management and audit problems.  
Audit logs are on, which is good, but the public endpoint, unencrypted secrets and tagging gaps need fixing to keep your apps secure.
