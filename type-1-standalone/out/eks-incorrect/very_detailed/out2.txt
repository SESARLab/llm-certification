The scan found 4 of 7 checks passed, but 3 key problems remain:

* The “musa‑dev” cluster is publicly reachable, letting anyone on the Internet try to access it.
* Sensitive data (Kubernetes secrets) aren’t encrypted, so if someone breaks in, they can read passwords or keys.
* The cluster lacks required tags, making it hard to track ownership, cost, or compliance.

These gaps could let attackers exploit the cluster, expose data, and make it hard to meet regulations.
