The probe found four out of seven checks passed. It’s good that API‑server audit logs are on, the cluster version is supported, and all clusters have audit logging. However, the “musa‑dev” cluster is reachable from the public internet, its Kubernetes secrets aren’t encrypted, and it lacks required tags. These gaps let attackers access or steal sensitive data, expose the cluster to external attacks, and make tracking or compliance auditing harder. Fixing them strengthens security and reduces risk.
