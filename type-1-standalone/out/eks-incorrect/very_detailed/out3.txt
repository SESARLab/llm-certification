Your cloud setup was scanned. Four of seven checks passed, so some settings are secure, like activity logging and current software. But three checks failed: the cluster can be accessed from the internet, its hidden data isn’t encrypted, and required identifiers are missing. These issues could let attackers see sensitive information, change data, or make the system non‑compliant. Fix them to protect your apps.
