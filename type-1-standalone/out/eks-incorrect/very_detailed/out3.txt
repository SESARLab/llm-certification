The scan found that the cluster “musa‑dev” is publicly reachable, its Kubernetes secrets aren’t encrypted, and required tags are missing. These gaps could let attackers access data or inject malicious code. On the plus side, the cluster uses a supported version and audit logging is enabled, helping track activity. Fixing public access, encryption, and tagging will strengthen overall security.
