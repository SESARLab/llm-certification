Your AWS Kubernetes cluster (musa‑dev) is partially secure. It logs API activity, uses a supported version, and has ID‑provider tags, which helps audit and manage access. However, the cluster is reachable from the internet, its secrets aren’t encrypted, and it lacks some required tags. These gaps let attackers see or steal sensitive data, gain unauthorized access, and make it harder to track who did what, potentially compromising your applications.
