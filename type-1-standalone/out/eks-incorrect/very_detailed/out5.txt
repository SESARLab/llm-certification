The probe ran fine and checked your AWS Kubernetes setup. 4 of 7 checks passed: logging is on, the cluster version is supported, and audit logs are enabled. However, your cluster is publicly reachable, its secrets aren’t encrypted, and it’s missing required tags. These gaps could let attackers see data, tamper with configurations, or violate compliance rules. Take action to lock the cluster, encrypt secrets, and add tags.
