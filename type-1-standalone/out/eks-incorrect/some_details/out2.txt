The security scan ran without errors and checked seven configuration rules for your Kubernetes cluster. Four rules were OK: audit logs are on, the cluster version is supported, ID‑provider settings have the right tags, and audit logging is enabled everywhere. Three rules failed: the cluster’s API endpoint is publicly reachable, Kubernetes secrets aren’t encrypted, and one required tag is missing. Fix those three to meet the recommended security standards.
