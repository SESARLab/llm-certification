The probe checked seven security settings for your AWS EKS cluster named musa‑dev. Four passed: audit logs are on, the cluster version is supported, IDP tags are correct, and audit logging works. Three failed: the cluster is reachable from the internet, its Kubernetes secrets aren’t encrypted, and a required tag is missing. Fix these to strengthen security.
