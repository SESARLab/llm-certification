The scan ran fine and checked seven security rules for your Kubernetes cluster. Four rules passed: logging is on, the cluster version is supported, and identity‑provider tags are correct. Three rules failed: the cluster’s API endpoint is publicly reachable, secrets are stored in plain text, and a required tag (tag1) is missing. Fix these to reduce exposure.
