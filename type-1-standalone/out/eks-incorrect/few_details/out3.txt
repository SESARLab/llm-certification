Your Kubernetes cluster “musa‑dev” was scanned. Four of the seven checks passed. Good: logging is enabled and the cluster version is supported. Problems: the cluster’s endpoint is publicly accessible, its secrets aren’t encrypted, and it’s missing a required tag. Fix these to improve security. All identity‑provider configs and audit logs are correctly set up.
