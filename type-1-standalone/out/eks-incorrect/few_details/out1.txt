The scan checked seven security checks for your EKS clusters. Four passed, three failed. Good news: logging is on, the cluster version is supported, and identity‑provider settings have the right tags. Problems: the cluster endpoint is publicly reachable, Kubernetes secrets aren’t encrypted, and one required tag is missing. These gaps could expose data or allow unauthorized access. Fixing them will improve overall security.
