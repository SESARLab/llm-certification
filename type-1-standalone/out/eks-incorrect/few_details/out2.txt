The test checked seven security rules on your Kubernetes cluster. Four rules passed: audit logs are on, the cluster version is supported, all clusters have audit logging, and identity‑provider configs are tagged. Three rules failed: the cluster’s endpoint is publicly reachable, Kubernetes secrets are not encrypted, and required tags are missing. Fix these to improve security.
