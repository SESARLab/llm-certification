Below is a **plain‑English “one‑page” version** of a typical security‑assessment report.  
It’s written for people who don’t need all the technical weeds but still want to know:

* what the assessment found,
* why it matters, and
* what should happen next.

Feel free to copy‑paste this template and replace the bullet points with the actual data from your own report.

## Executive Summary (≤ 3 sentences)

> The security assessment examined the company’s network, applications, and cloud services.  
> Overall, the organization is **in good shape** but has a handful of high‑impact gaps that could let attackers gain access to sensitive data or disrupt services.  
> Fixing those gaps will make the environment far more resilient and help meet compliance requirements.

## 1️⃣ Key Findings – What We Discovered

| Priority | Area | Issue | Impact | Likelihood | Example |
|----------|------|-------|--------|------------|---------|
| **High** | Network perimeter (firewalls & VPNs) | Unnecessary open ports & weak VPN passwords | Remote attacker could pivot into the internal network | Very likely | Port 3389 is open to the Internet with weak passwords |
| **High** | Web applications | SQL‑Injection vulnerability in the “Order” page | Data exfiltration & data tampering | Likely | Attackers could read all order details |
| **Medium** | Cloud (AWS) | IAM role “ReadOnly” has “CreateBucket” permission | Insider could unintentionally create public buckets | Possible | “ReadOnly” role can create an S3 bucket that is publicly readable |
| **Low** | Endpoint security | 12 % of workstations missing the latest OS patch | Minor attack surface | Low | Two laptops are still on Windows 7 |

*(Only the most important findings are shown – the real report will list many more, but you can keep the table to 5–10 items.)*

## 2️⃣ Why These Findings Matter

* **High‑Priority Gaps** – If exploited, an attacker could:
  * Access customer data (financial, personal, or health information).
  * Shut down critical services (e.g., e‑commerce checkout, data backups).
  * Use the system as a launchpad for further attacks.

* **Medium/Low‑Priority Gaps** – Still worth fixing to:
  * Harden the environment and reduce future risk.
  * Meet industry regulations (PCI‑DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, etc.).
  * Build trust with partners and customers.

## 3️⃣ Recommended Remediation (Short‑Term Fixes)

| Priority | Fix | Who Should Do It | Timeline |
|----------|-----|------------------|----------|
| **High** | Block port 3389 from the Internet; enforce MFA for VPN | Network Ops / Security | 1–2 days |
| **High** | Patch SQL‑Injection flaw in Order page | Web Dev Team | 3–5 days |
| **Medium** | Remove “CreateBucket” permission from ReadOnly role | Cloud Ops | 1–3 days |
| **Low** | Deploy missing OS patches on all workstations | IT Helpdesk | 1–7 days |

> *Tip:* Use a “rule‑based” approach: fix the highest‑risk issues first, then move down the list.

## 4️⃣ Long‑Term Recommendations

1. **Implement a Zero‑Trust architecture** – least‑privilege everywhere, continuous authentication, and micro‑segmentation.  
2. **Adopt automated vulnerability scanning** – run weekly scans for the web, network, and cloud.  
3. **Establish a patch‑management policy** – schedule patch windows, test patches, and track compliance.  
4. **Conduct regular security training** – phishing simulations, secure coding practices, and incident‑response drills.  
5. **Create an Incident Response Plan** – define roles, escalation paths, and recovery steps.

## 5️⃣ Next Steps for Management

| Action | Owner | Deadline | Status |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| Approve budget for security tools | CFO | 30 days | ☐ |
| Sign off on remediation schedule | COO | 7 days | ☐ |
| Schedule follow‑up assessment | CISO | 90 days | ☐ |

## 📌 Quick Takeaway

* **We found a few serious holes that could let attackers compromise the network and data.**  
* Fixing those holes is urgent, but a solid, ongoing security program will keep the organization safe in the long run.
