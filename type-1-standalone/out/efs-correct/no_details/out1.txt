**What the report says in plain English**

| Item | What it means |
|------|----------------|
| **Probe status** | “The probe executed successfully!” – the test ran without any errors. |
| **Overall result** | “1/1 succeeded” – the single test that was run finished correctly. |
| **EFS check (EFS.1)** | *Passed* – the system has no Microsoft EFS (Encrypted File System) volumes to evaluate, so there’s nothing that needs encrypting. |
| **CVE findings** | None – the report didn’t find any known security weaknesses. |

**Bottom line:**  
The security assessment found no problems. There are no encrypted file systems to protect and no vulnerabilities that need fixing. Everything is compliant, so you don’t need to take any action right now.
