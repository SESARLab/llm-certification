**Security Check Summary (Plain English)**

| What was checked | Result | What it means |
|------------------|--------|----------------|
| **Overall probe** | ✔️ “The probe executed successfully!” | The scan ran without errors. |
| **EFS (Encrypted File System) check** | ✔️ No EFS file systems found | Your system doesn’t have any encrypted filesystems in the places the check looked. Therefore, there’s nothing to encrypt or protect with EFS. |
| **Vulnerabilities (CVE list)** | 0 | No known CVE‑based problems were found. |

### Bottom line

The assessment ran correctly and found no issues. Because there were no encrypted filesystems to protect, the EFS check passed automatically. Nothing needs to be fixed—your system is compliant with this particular test.
