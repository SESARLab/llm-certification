**What the report tells you in plain English**

| Item | What it means |
|------|----------------|
| **`integer_result: 0`** | The scan finished without any errors. |
| **`pretty_result: "The probe executed successfully!"`** | The tool ran to completion and didn’t hit any problems. |
| **`EFS.1`** | The probe looked for Windows “Encrypting File System” (EFS) volumes – the ones that automatically encrypt files. |
| **`Passed: true`** | It found nothing that was out of the ordinary. |
| **`Result: "No EFS file systems found, nothing to encrypt"`** | There are no EFS‑enabled drives or folders on the system, so there’s nothing to protect or audit. |
| **`Compliant/Non‑Compliant File Systems`** | Both lists are empty because there were no EFS volumes to check. |

### Bottom line

The assessment ran fine, didn’t discover any security issues, and found that your system doesn’t have any EFS file systems in use. No action is required.
