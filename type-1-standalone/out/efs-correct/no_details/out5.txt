**What the report tells you in plain English**

- **Probe ran without any problems** – the tool worked and finished its job, so the “probe executed successfully!” message means everything ran as expected.

- **What was checked** – The only test performed was a look‑for‑EFS scan.  
  - *EFS* (Encrypting File System) is a Windows feature that encrypts files on disk.  
  - The probe searched all file systems on the target machine for EFS‑encrypted volumes.

- **Result of the scan** –  
  - **No EFS file systems were found**.  
  - Because there were no EFS volumes, there was nothing to encrypt or check further.  
  - Both the “Compliant” and “Non‑Compliant” lists are empty because there were no file systems to evaluate.

- **Vulnerabilities** – The report’s CVE list is empty, so no known security vulnerabilities were discovered during this check.

**Bottom line**  
The assessment finished cleanly, found no EFS‑encrypted drives, and identified no security issues. No action is required based on this particular probe.
