**What the report tells you in plain English**

- **Overall outcome** – The security probe ran without any problems (“The probe executed successfully!”).  
- **What was checked** – The only test performed was a look‑for‑EFS‑file‑system check (EFS = Encrypting File System, the Windows feature that can automatically encrypt files).  
- **Result of that check** –  
  - *Passed* – The system has **no EFS file systems at all**, so there was nothing to encrypt.  
  - Because there are no EFS volumes, there are no “Non‑Compliant” or “Compliant” file systems to list.  
- **Vulnerability list** – The `cve` array is empty, meaning the probe didn’t find any known CVEs during its run.

**Bottom line:** The target machine didn’t have any EFS volumes, so the compliance check for that feature succeeded and no security issues were uncovered in this assessment.
