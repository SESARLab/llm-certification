Your security test ran without problems. It checked for Amazon EFS storage that might lack encryption, but found none, so everything is safe. No configuration errors were found, so the apps are protected from that risk. If you add EFS later, make sure to encrypt it. Overall, your AWS setup is secure for this check.
