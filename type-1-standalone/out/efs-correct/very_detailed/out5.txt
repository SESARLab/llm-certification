**Simple Summary:**  
The security scan ran correctly and found no problems. It checked your AWS file storage (EFS) and saw that you don’t have any EFS file systems set up, so there’s nothing that could be exposed or unencrypted. In short, the part of the environment tested is safe, but it only covers that specific setting.
