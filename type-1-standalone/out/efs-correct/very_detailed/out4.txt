The security check ran without problems and found no Amazon EFS file systems that need encryption. In plain terms, there are no exposed file‑storage areas that could let attackers read or tamper with data. Because nothing was found, there’s no immediate risk from EFS misconfiguration in this environment. If new file‑storage services are added later, they’ll need to be checked again.
