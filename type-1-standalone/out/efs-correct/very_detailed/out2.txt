The probe returned 0, meaning it ran fine. No Amazon EFS file systems were found, so there’s nothing at risk of being read by unauthorized users. Because EFS was not in use, encryption concerns are irrelevant. This check covers only one part of your AWS setup. Continue monitoring other services and keep them updated to stay secure.
