Your account shows no security gaps: every security group blocks public inbound traffic, the only VPC logs traffic, all stored data is encrypted, and instance metadata protection is on. Network rules prevent remote‑admin access from the internet. No known vulnerabilities (CVEs) were found. In short, your AWS setup follows best‑practice security checks and is fully compliant.
