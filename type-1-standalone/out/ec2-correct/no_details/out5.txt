## Quick‑look summary

Your security scan ran without any hiccups – all tests came back **green**.  
In plain English:

| Test | What it checks | Result |
|------|----------------|--------|
| **CIS EC2.2** | Default security groups have no open traffic | ✅ Passed – the only group (`sg‑0c063b93959ff3eb5`) is tight. |
| **CIS EC2.6** | VPC flow logs are on | ✅ Passed – your VPC (`vpc‑0fb33f847f5cb2033`) is logging traffic. |
| **CIS EC2.7** | EBS volumes are encrypted by default | ✅ Passed – all new EBS volumes will be encrypted automatically. |
| **CIS EC2.8** | Instance Metadata Service v2 (IMDSv2) is enforced | ✅ Passed – no instance is using the old, insecure IMDSv1. |
| **CIS EC2.21** | Network ACLs don’t allow SSH (22) or RDP (3389) from the world | ✅ Passed – the only ACL (`acl‑0cf7d0c72e88044a7`) blocks those ports for 0.0.0.0/0. |
| **CIS EC2.53** | Security groups don’t allow remote‑admin ports from the world (IPv4) | ✅ Passed – `sg‑0c063b93959ff3eb5` blocks 0.0.0.0/0. |
| **CIS EC2.54** | Same as above but for IPv6 (`::/0`) | ✅ Passed – no open ports from anywhere. |

> **Overall:** “7/7 succeeded” – every checked control is compliant.

## What this means for you

- **Your environment is hardened against the most common AWS security gaps.**  
  No public SSH/RDP, no unencrypted EBS, and you’re actively watching traffic with flow logs.

- **You’re already following CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark best‑practice.**  
  This is a strong foundation for any workload.

- **No critical issues found.**  
  You can confidently move forward, but always stay vigilant – new services, changes, or misconfigurations can introduce gaps.

## Next steps (optional)

| Recommendation | Why it helps |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Enable GuardDuty or Macie** | Adds continuous threat detection and data protection. |
| **Implement least‑privilege IAM policies** | Tighten user access beyond network controls. |
| **Periodic re‑assessment** | AWS evolves; run this scan every 3–6 months to catch new controls or misconfigurations. |
| **Automate compliance checks** | Use tools like AWS Config rules or third‑party services to get real‑time alerts. |
