**Quick‑look Summary**

- **The security probe ran without any problems** – it finished cleanly and found no issues.
- **All 7 of the checks it ran were passed**.  
- No known vulnerabilities (CVE list is empty).
- The report is focused on your Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 environment – the virtual machines and the network around them.

## What each test means (in plain English)

| # | What was tested | Why it matters | Result |
|---|-----------------|----------------|--------|
| **CIS EC2.2** | *Security groups (the virtual firewall) have no open inbound or outbound rules.* | Prevents strangers from reaching your servers or letting your servers reach the internet without permission. | ✅ **All 1 security group (sg‑0c063b93959ff3eb5) is locked down** – no traffic is allowed in or out. |
| **CIS EC2.6** | *VPC (the whole private network) has flow‑logging enabled.* | Flow logs keep a record of all network traffic – useful for troubleshooting and spotting suspicious activity. | ✅ **VPC vpc‑0fb33f847f5cb2033 is logging everything**. |
| **CIS EC2.7** | *EBS (Elastic Block Store) default encryption is on.* | All new disk volumes are automatically encrypted, protecting data at rest. | ✅ Encryption is enabled. |
| **CIS EC2.8** | *Instances enforce IMDSv2 (the newer, safer way to get instance metadata).* | Prevents “metadata injection” attacks that could give attackers sensitive data. | ✅ **All 0 instances already enforce IMDSv2** – nothing to change. |
| **CIS EC2.21** | *Network ACLs (extra layer of firewall at the subnet level) do not let anyone hit SSH (port 22) or RDP (port 3389) from the whole internet.* | Blocks brute‑force login attempts from anywhere on the internet. | ✅ **ACL acl‑0cf7d0c72e88044a7 blocks those ports**. |
| **CIS EC2.53** | *Security groups do not allow anyone from the public internet to access remote‑admin ports.* | Same idea as above but checked in the security‑group rules. | ✅ **sg‑0c063b93959ff3eb5 blocks public access**. |
| **CIS EC2.54** | *Same as EC2.53, but checks the IPv6 world (`::/0`).* | Ensures IPv6 traffic is also protected. | ✅ **IPv6 inbound is blocked too**. |

## Takeaway

- **Everything you tested is compliant.** No open ports, no unencrypted disks, and proper logging are all in place.
- The AWS environment is well‑guarded against common remote‑access attacks and is set up to keep logs of what’s happening.
- Keep the same settings, and remember to review them whenever you add new resources, change security‑group rules, or enable new services.

**Bottom line:** Your EC2 setup is in great shape right now. Keep monitoring and keep following these CIS best‑practice checks as you grow your infrastructure.
