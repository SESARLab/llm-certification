### Bottom line

- **Everything checked out** – all seven CIS‑EC2 best‑practice checks were satisfied.
- **No misconfigurations or vulnerabilities** were found in the areas that were examined.
- **Zero CVEs** were identified in the report.

This means your AWS EC2 environment is well‑protected against the most common configuration weaknesses covered by the CIS benchmark. Keep monitoring and keep the controls in place!
