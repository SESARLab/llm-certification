### The 7 CIS (Center for Internet Security) checks that were run

| Check | Why it matters | What we found |
|-------|----------------|---------------|
| **EC2.2 – Default security groups** | Default groups are the safety nets around your virtual servers. They should be tight‑knit, not letting traffic in or out by accident. | All default groups are *closed* – no inbound or outbound traffic allowed. |
| **EC2.6 – VPC flow logs** | Flow logs record every network traffic record in your virtual private cloud (VPC). They’re essential for spotting weird or malicious traffic. | Flow logging is **enabled and actively recording** for the VPC. |
| **EC2.7 – EBS encryption** | Data at rest in Amazon’s block storage (EBS) must be encrypted by default, otherwise a rogue user could read it. | Encryption is **enabled by default** for all EBS volumes. |
| **EC2.8 – IMDSv2** | The Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) lets your server learn about itself. Version 2 adds a security “token” to prevent data leaks. | All instances are **required to use IMDSv2** – no old, insecure versions. |
| **EC2.21 – Network ACLs** | Network ACLs act like firewalls for the whole subnet. They should block remote‑administration ports from the public internet. | No ACL allows anyone from the whole world (`0.0.0.0/0`) to hit SSH (port 22) or RDP (port 3389). |
| **EC2.53 – Security groups (IPv4)** | Security groups are like the last line of defense. They should never let the world open admin ports. | All security groups **block `0.0.0.0/0`** from SSH or RDP. |
| **EC2.54 – Security groups (IPv6)** | Same rule, but for the newer IPv6 world. | All security groups **block `::/0`** from SSH or RDP. |

### Bottom line

- **All key security controls are in place.**  
- **No public vulnerabilities (CVE) were found.**  
- **The environment is compliant with the relevant CIS benchmarks for EC2.**

If you keep the current settings and keep monitoring, you’re in a solid security posture for the parts of AWS that were checked. If you want to go further, you could look at other CIS sections (e.g., IAM, S3) or run more frequent scans, but nothing in this report indicates a problem.
