The scan checked your AWS settings and found no problems.  
All security groups block unwanted traffic, the VPC logs every network move, data on disks is automatically encrypted, and remote‑access ports (SSH/Remote Desktop) are closed to the internet.  
This means attackers can’t easily reach your servers, your activity is recorded, and any stored data stays protected. No immediate risk exists from configuration errors.
