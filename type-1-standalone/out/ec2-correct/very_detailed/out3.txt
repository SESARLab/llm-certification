Your AWS setup passed the security probe. All default security groups block inbound/outbound traffic, SSH/RDP ports are locked, VPC flow logs are on, and all disks are encrypted. No critical misconfigurations were found, so the risk of unauthorized access or data theft is low. Continue to monitor and keep these controls active to maintain protection.
