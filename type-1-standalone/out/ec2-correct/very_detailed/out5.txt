Your AWS setup passed all 7 security checks.  
- No public ports are open, so attackers can’t reach servers via SSH or RDP.  
- Traffic logs are enabled, letting you see who’s accessing the network.  
- All disks are encrypted, protecting data even if someone gets physical access.  
- Default security groups are closed to outside traffic.  

Overall, the risk of a data breach or unauthorized entry is very low, keeping your applications secure.
