**What the scan shows:**  
Your AWS account passed the only check that the probe ran – a proper security‑contact record is in place. No configuration mistakes or known vulnerabilities were found.  

**Why it matters:**  
Having a designated security contact (email, phone, name) means any security alerts will reach the right people fast, reducing the chance that a breach goes unnoticed. Your environment is currently secure against the tested configuration issue.
