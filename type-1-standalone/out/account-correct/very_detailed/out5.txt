The security probe ran without errors and found no problems. It confirmed that your AWS account has a valid security contact—email, phone, and name—so alerts and incident notices can reach the right person. Since no configuration mistakes were detected, your environment is in good shape. If the contact info were missing, critical alerts might go unnoticed.
