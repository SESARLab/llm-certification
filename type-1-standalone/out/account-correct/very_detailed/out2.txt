**Simple Summary**

Your cloud security scan ran fine and found no problems. It checked that your AWS account has a designated security contact—an email, phone number, and name—so if any incident happens, the right people can be alerted quickly. Because everything passed, you’re currently protected against the common configuration errors it looks for. Keep the contact details up‑to‑date and review the scan periodically to stay secure.
