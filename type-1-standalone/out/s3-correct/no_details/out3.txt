**Quick Take‑away**

- The scan ran fine – no errors were reported.  
- **All 4 S3 security checks passed.**  
- No buckets were exposed to the public, no unsecured traffic, and every bucket has MFA delete enabled.  
- No known CVEs were found.  

So, from a security perspective, your S3 buckets are fully compliant with the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark (the four checks that were run).

### What each check means

| Check | What it tests | Result | What it gives you |
|-------|---------------|--------|-------------------|
| **CIS S3.1 – Public access block** | Ensures bucket ACLs and policies can’t allow anyone on the internet to read, write or list the bucket. | **Passed** | All buckets have *BlockPublicAcls*, *IgnorePublicAcls*, *BlockPublicPolicy*, *RestrictPublicBuckets* enabled. |
| **CIS S3.5 – SSL‑only traffic** | Requires that every request to the bucket be made over HTTPS. | **Passed** | Every bucket forces SSL‑only access. |
| **CIS S3.8 – Block public access (bucket level)** | Makes sure the bucket’s policy doesn’t grant any public read/write permissions. | **Passed** | All buckets block public access. |
| **CIS S3.20 – MFA delete** | Adds an extra authentication step before you can delete or overwrite objects in a versioned bucket. | **Passed** | Every bucket has MFA delete turned on. |

### Bottom line

- **Zero public‑access risks** – nobody outside your organization can reach the data.  
- **Encrypted traffic only** – data in transit is protected.  
- **MFA delete enabled** – even if someone gains credentials, they’d still need a second factor to delete or overwrite objects.  

Your current S3 configuration is solid and follows AWS best‑practice security controls. No further action is needed unless you plan to add new buckets or change these settings. If you ever need to add a bucket, just double‑check that the same four controls are enabled.
