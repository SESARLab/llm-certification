**Quick‑look summary**

| What was checked | Result | What it means |
|------------------|--------|---------------|
| Overall probe | ✔ Success | The security scan ran without errors. |
| CVE list | – | No known vulnerabilities were found in the assessed services. |
| **CIS S3.1 – Public access block** | ✔ All 19 buckets have *BlockPublicAcls*, *IgnorePublicAcls*, *BlockPublicPolicy*, and *RestrictPublicBuckets* turned on. | No bucket is exposed to the internet or to other accounts unless explicitly allowed. |
| **CIS S3.5 – SSL‑only requests** | ✔ All buckets enforce HTTPS. | Data in transit is encrypted; traffic cannot be sniffed or tampered with. |
| **CIS S3.8 – Public access blocked** | ✔ Every bucket blocks public access. | Even if an ACL or policy were accidentally set to allow public reads, the block overrides it. |
| **CIS S3.20 – MFA delete** | ✔ MFA delete is enabled on every bucket. | Even if someone changes a bucket’s policy, they’d still need a second factor (e.g., a one‑time code from a device) to delete or replace objects. |

### Why this matters

- **Zero public exposure** – All buckets are locked down against accidental or malicious public reads/writes.  
- **Encrypted traffic** – HTTPS enforcement protects data while it moves between your users/devices and AWS.  
- **Strong deletion protection** – MFA delete adds a second line of defense against accidental data loss or sabotage.  
- **No known CVEs** – The tools you’re using (AWS S3 in this case) don’t have any publicly disclosed bugs that could be exploited.

### Bottom line

Your S3 buckets are following the AWS CIS benchmark best‑practice controls perfectly. The environment is well‑protected against common misconfigurations and data‑exposure risks. Keep monitoring for new CVEs or changes in policy, but for now the setup is solid.
