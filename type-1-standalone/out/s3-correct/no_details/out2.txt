### What the report actually checked

| Control | What it means in plain English | How we know it’s good |
|---------|--------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **CIS S3.1 – Block public ACLs** | No bucket can be made public by simply adding a public access ACL. | All four “BlockPublicAcls”, “IgnorePublicAcls”, “BlockPublicPolicy”, “RestrictPublicBuckets” settings are turned on. |
| **CIS S3.5 – SSL‑only access** | All traffic to your buckets must use HTTPS; plain‑text HTTP is blocked. | Every bucket listed in the report (19 in total) is required to use SSL‑only requests. |
| **CIS S3.8 – Block public access** | Even if a bucket policy tries to grant public access, it is blocked. | Every bucket is shown as “compliant”; none are “Non‑Compliant”. |
| **CIS S3.20 – MFA delete** | Deleting or permanently changing objects in a bucket requires a second authentication factor (MFA). | All buckets have MFA delete enabled. |

### Which buckets were checked?

The report lists 19 S3 buckets that were inspected. All of them are in the **Compliant Buckets** list for every control – none appear in a “Non‑Compliant” list.

---

### Bottom line

* **Everything is set up correctly.**  
  Your S3 buckets are properly locked down against public access, are forcing encrypted traffic, and protect against accidental deletion with MFA delete.

* **No vulnerabilities found.**  
  The CVE list is empty and the integer result is `0`, meaning no security issues were detected.

### What to do next

| Action | Why it matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Keep these settings** | The controls are the best‑practice baseline; leaving them on protects you from accidental exposure or data loss. |
| **Review periodically** | When you add new buckets or change policies, run this probe again to confirm compliance. |
| **Document controls** | Maintain a short SOP that references these controls so future team members know why each setting is required. |
| **Extend the scan** | If you want to be extra sure, you can add other controls (e.g., encryption at rest, bucket lifecycle rules) or use a third‑party scanner. |

---

**In a nutshell:**  
Your S3 environment is fully compliant with the most critical CIS controls, no public access is possible, data can only be transferred over HTTPS, and deleting objects requires MFA. All good – keep it that way!
