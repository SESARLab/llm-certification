The assessment checked 4 key security settings for all your S3 buckets and found every one of them to be correctly configured. All buckets block public access, require encrypted (SSL) connections, and use MFA delete for extra protection against accidental or malicious changes. In short, no configuration risks were found – your data is well‑protected against common cloud threats.
