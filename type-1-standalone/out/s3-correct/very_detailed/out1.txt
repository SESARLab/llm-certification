The scan ran fine and found no problems. All your AWS storage buckets block public access, accept only encrypted (SSL) connections, and use MFA‑delete to prevent accidental or malicious deletions. In short, your data can’t be viewed by strangers, must be sent securely, and can’t be removed without a second confirmation—so your applications stay protected.
