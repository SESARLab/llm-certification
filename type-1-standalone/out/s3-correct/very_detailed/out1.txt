The probe ran without issues and found no problems. All 18 S3 buckets are locked down: they refuse public access, require encrypted (SSL) connections, and protect against accidental deletion with MFA. In plain terms, your data is safely hidden from strangers, only reachable over secure links, and can’t be removed without a second verification step. Overall, your AWS storage setup is solid and poses very low risk.
