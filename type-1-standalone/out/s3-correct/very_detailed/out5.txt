The security scan finished with a clean bill of health. Every S3 bucket in your AWS account is locked down: no one can access them from the internet, all file transfers must use a secure (SSL) connection, and even deletion of files requires two‑factor authentication. This means your data is protected from accidental exposure, tampering, or loss. No configuration errors were found.
