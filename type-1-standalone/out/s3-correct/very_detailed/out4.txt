The security scan found no problems.  
All your AWS storage buckets have:  

* **Public access blocked** – no one can see or download data without permission.  
* **SSL‑only access** – data travels safely over encryption.  
* **MFA delete enabled** – you need a second authentication step to delete files.  

Because every check passed, there is no risk of accidental data exposure, unauthorized access, or accidental deletion. Your application data is protected as expected.
