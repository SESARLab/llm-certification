The scan checked your Amazon S3 storage buckets and found no problems. All buckets are locked down: public access is blocked, data can only be sent over secure (SSL) connections, and extra protection (MFA delete) is on for all of them. In short, your S3 setup is secure and follows best‑practice guidelines. No changes are needed.
