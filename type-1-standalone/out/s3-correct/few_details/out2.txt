The security scan ran fine and found no problems. All your S3 storage buckets are locked down: they’re not publicly visible, only allow secure (HTTPS) connections, and have an extra “MFA delete” safety lock. In short, your data is protected against accidental or malicious exposure. No action needed—everything is compliant.
