### Quick‑Look Summary  

| What was tested | How many succeeded | How many failed | What it means |
|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 4 CIS‑Amazon‑S3 security controls | 0 | 4 | All the recommended settings are **not** in place – your S3 buckets are exposed and can be modified or accessed in unsafe ways. |

There were **no known CVE issues** in the scan, but the configuration problems create real risks.

## What each control checks

| Control | What it checks | Why it matters | Your status |
|---------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **CIS S3.1 – Block Public ACLs & Policies** | Disables or removes *public* access granted via ACLs or bucket policies. | Prevents accidental exposure of data to the internet. | **Failed** – all 4 public‑ACL settings are missing or disabled. |
| **CIS S3.5 – Enforce SSL‑Only** | Forces all requests to the bucket to go over HTTPS. | Stops data from being sniffed on the wire. | **Failed** – every bucket (19 total) allows non‑SSL traffic. |
| **CIS S3.8 – Block Public Access** | Globally blocks public access to buckets via the *Block Public Access* setting. | The single most effective way to stop anyone from reading or writing to a bucket. | **Failed** – one bucket (“musa‑webapp”) is still publicly readable. |
| **CIS S3.20 – Enable MFA Delete** | Adds a second factor (MFA) before a bucket version can be deleted. | Protects against accidental or malicious deletion of important data. | **Failed** – none of the 19 buckets have MFA Delete enabled. |

## How bad is it?

- **Data exposure** – Any bucket that is publicly readable can be accessed by anyone on the internet.
- **Man‑in‑the‑middle** – Traffic that isn’t forced to HTTPS can be intercepted, altered, or dropped.
- **Data loss** – Without MFA Delete, a single user (or a compromised account) could permanently delete data, and it would be hard to recover.

These settings are *mandatory* in many compliance frameworks (HIPAA, PCI‑DSS, SOC 2, ISO 27001). Failing all four puts you in non‑compliance and increases the likelihood of a breach.

## Remediation Roadmap (in 3 easy steps)

| Step | What to do | Where to do it |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **1️⃣ Turn on Block Public Access** | In the S3 console → *Permissions* → *Block public access (bucket settings)*, enable *All* options. | Every bucket. |
| **2️⃣ Enforce SSL‑Only** | In the bucket policy, add a condition that blocks any request that isn’t HTTPS (`aws:SecureTransport = "true"`). | All buckets. |
| **3️⃣ Enable MFA Delete** | Enable MFA Delete via the AWS CLI or console (requires S3 versioning already enabled). | All buckets that store critical data. |

> **Tip:** Use the AWS Config rule “s3-bucket-block-public-access” to automatically flag buckets that slip out of compliance, and the “s3-bucket-ssl-only” rule for HTTPS enforcement.

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize the “musa‑webapp” bucket** – it is the only one still publicly accessible; secure it first.  
2. **Automate** the changes: create an IaC (Infrastructure‑as‑Code) template or a CloudFormation stack that sets all four rules, and run it across all buckets.  
3. **Run the probe again** to confirm all 4 checks pass.  
4. **Set up alerts** (AWS Config, CloudWatch, or third‑party tools) to be notified if any bucket changes its settings.

### Bottom line  
All four critical S3 security controls are currently turned off or misconfigured. Fixing these will dramatically reduce your risk surface and bring you back into compliance with major security standards. Let’s get those buckets locked down!
