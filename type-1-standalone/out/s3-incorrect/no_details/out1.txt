**What the assessment checked**

| Check | What it means | How you fared |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| **CIS S3.1** – “Block public ACLs & policies” | Blocks anyone from making your bucket publicly readable or writable. | **All 4 settings are turned off** → your buckets can be opened to the public. |
| **CIS S3.5** – “Enforce SSL‑only requests” | Forces every request to use HTTPS so data in transit can’t be sniffed. | **All 19 buckets allow HTTP** → traffic could be intercepted. |
| **CIS S3.8** – “Block public access” | Overrides any bucket‑ or object‑level settings that would let the public read or write. | 1 bucket (`musa-webapp`) is not blocked → it’s still publicly reachable. |
| **CIS S3.20** – “Enable MFA delete” | Requires a second authentication factor when deleting or changing objects, protecting against accidental or malicious data loss. | **None of the 19 buckets have it enabled** → data can be removed with a single credential. |

**Bottom line**

- The probe ran fine (your “pretty result” says so), but none of the checks were passed.  
- Your S3 buckets are **open to the public**, **accept non‑secure traffic**, **lack an extra layer of deletion protection**, and **have no MFA delete** enabled.

**Why it matters**

| Risk | Consequence |
|------|-------------|
| Public access | Anyone on the internet can read, copy, or delete your data. |
| No SSL only | Traffic could be eavesdropped, tampered with, or spoofed. |
| No MFA delete | A single credential compromise can delete or overwrite critical data. |

**Next steps (quick wins)**

1. **Block public ACLs & policies** (CIS S3.1).  
   *Enable “BlockPublicAcls”, “IgnorePublicAcls”, “BlockPublicPolicy”, and “RestrictPublicBuckets”* in each bucket.  

2. **Enforce HTTPS** (CIS S3.5).  
   *Set the “Bucket Policy” or “Access Control List” to require SSL‑only requests.*  

3. **Block public access for all buckets** (CIS S3.8).  
   *Mark every bucket with “Block public access” in the S3 console.*  

4. **Enable MFA delete** (CIS S3.20).  
   *Turn on MFA delete for each bucket that holds sensitive or critical data.*  

After you make these changes, re‑run the probe or run a quick audit yourself to confirm everything passes. This will dramatically reduce the attack surface of your S3 storage.
