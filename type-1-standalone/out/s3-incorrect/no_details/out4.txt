## Quick‑look Summary

| Check | Pass/Fail | What it means | How many buckets affected |
|-------|-----------|---------------|--------------------------|
| **CIS S3.1** – block public ACLs, policies, etc. | ❌ *Failed* | Public access is still allowed. | **4** settings are turned off in **all 19** buckets |
| **CIS S3.5** – require HTTPS (SSL‑only) | ❌ *Failed* | Data can be sent in clear‑text. | **19** buckets |
| **CIS S3.8** – block public access at bucket level | ❌ *Failed* | One bucket is openly readable. | **1** bucket (`musa-webapp`) |
| **CIS S3.20** – enable MFA delete | ❌ *Failed* | Even with MFA, objects can be deleted. | **19** buckets |

**Overall:** 0 of 4 security controls passed → every S3 bucket is at high risk.

## What the numbers actually say

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **CIS S3.1** | All four settings that prevent public ACLs/policies are *disabled or missing*. If an object or bucket is set to “public”, anyone on the internet can read, write, or delete it. |
| **CIS S3.5** | None of the buckets enforce HTTPS. Traffic (including credentials) can travel in plain text, which attackers can sniff or tamper with. |
| **CIS S3.8** | Only one bucket (`musa-webapp`) is *publicly accessible* at the bucket level. The rest have the public‑access block turned on, but other controls still allow public ACLs. |
| **CIS S3.20** | No bucket has MFA delete enabled. With MFA delete off, a single credential holder can delete or overwrite any object, even if the bucket is otherwise locked. |

## Why this matters

1. **Data leakage** – Public ACLs/policies expose sensitive files to anyone who knows the URL.
2. **Man‑in‑the‑Middle (MITM)** – Without HTTPS, attackers can intercept or modify data in transit.
3. **Persistence & destruction** – MFA delete adds a second layer of protection against accidental or malicious deletions. Without it, a single compromised account can wipe entire datasets.
4. **Compliance** – Most regulatory frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI‑DSS, etc.) require encryption in transit and controlled access. These buckets are non‑compliant.

## Quick fix checklist

| Control | Action | Tool/Command |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| **Block public ACLs & policies** | Enable `BlockPublicAcls`, `IgnorePublicAcls`, `BlockPublicPolicy`, `RestrictPublicBuckets` on every bucket | AWS Console → S3 → Bucket → Permissions → Block public access (checkbox) |
| **Force HTTPS** | Set bucket policy to deny non‑HTTPS requests | `aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket <name> --policy file://policy.json` (policy includes `"aws:SecureTransport": "aws:SecureTransport"`) |
| **Block public access** | Ensure the bucket‑level block public access is on for `musa-webapp` | Same as above – check the “Block all public access” toggle |
| **Enable MFA delete** | Turn on MFA delete for all buckets that store critical data | `aws s3api put-bucket-versioning --bucket <name> --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled,MFADelete=Enabled` (requires MFA token) |

---

## How to keep it safe long‑term

1. **Automate compliance** – Use AWS Config rules (`s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited`, `s3-bucket-ssl-enabled`, etc.) to get continuous monitoring and automatic remediation.
2. **Least‑privilege IAM** – Grant users only the permissions they need; avoid giving broad “S3 full control”.
3. **Versioning & MFA** – Keep versioning enabled and MFA delete for buckets that hold irreplaceable data.
4. **Regular audits** – Run the same assessment monthly or after every major change.

### Bottom line

All 19 S3 buckets are currently *exposed* to the public internet, lack HTTPS enforcement, and have no extra protection against deletion. Fixing these four controls will dramatically reduce the risk of data loss, theft, or compliance violations. 🚨✅
