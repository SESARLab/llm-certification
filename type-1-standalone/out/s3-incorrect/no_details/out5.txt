**What the scan found – in plain English**

| # | What we checked | What we saw | Why it matters |
|---|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | **CIS S3.1 – Public ACL controls** | All 4 key security settings that block public ACLs are **missing or turned off**. | Anyone could give public read/write access to your buckets, which could let data leak or be tampered with. |
| 2 | **CIS S3.5 – SSL‑only access** | Every one of the 19 buckets can be accessed *without* HTTPS. | Non‑SSL traffic can be sniffed or altered, exposing sensitive data. |
| 3 | **CIS S3.8 – Block public access** | 18 buckets are protected, but **one bucket (musa‑webapp)** is still publicly accessible. | Public buckets can be read by anyone on the internet. |
| 4 | **CIS S3.20 – MFA delete** | None of the 19 buckets have Multi‑Factor Authentication (MFA) delete enabled. | Even if a bad actor deletes a bucket, you have no extra layer of protection to recover it. |

**Bottom line:**  
The probe ran fine (`The probe executed successfully!`), but **all four** of the key S3 security controls that AWS recommends were **not met**. In short, your S3 buckets are open to public changes, can be accessed insecurely, one bucket is publicly readable, and there’s no extra protection against accidental or malicious deletes.

**Quick next steps**

1. **Enable the four settings in CIS S3.1** (`BlockPublicAcls`, `IgnorePublicAcls`, `BlockPublicPolicy`, `RestrictPublicBuckets`).
2. **Require HTTPS** for all buckets – set `ForceSSL` or `RequireTLS` where available.
3. **Block public access** on the `musa-webapp` bucket (and double‑check any other that may slip through).
4. **Turn on MFA delete** for any bucket that holds critical data.

Once those changes are in place, re‑run the scan – you should see the controls pass and your bucket configuration move to a safer state.
