Your AWS S3 storage has several security gaps. All four checks failed: no public‑access controls, no SSL‑only traffic enforcement, and no MFA delete on any bucket. 19 buckets lack these safeguards, and one bucket is publicly accessible. You should lock down permissions, enforce HTTPS, and enable MFA delete to protect data from accidental or malicious changes.
