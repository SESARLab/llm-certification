The scan ran fine. It found all 19 S3 buckets lack critical security settings: none block public ACLs, all allow non‑SSL traffic, and none have MFA delete. One bucket (musa‑webapp) is publicly readable. These misconfigurations could let attackers read or delete data. Action is needed to enable public‑ACL restrictions, enforce SSL, and enable MFA delete.
