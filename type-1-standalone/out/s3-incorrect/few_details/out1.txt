The scan ran fine but found several problems with your Amazon S3 storage.  
- None of the 4 core security settings (block public ACLs, policy, etc.) are enabled.  
- All 19 buckets allow non‑SSL traffic, meaning data can be intercepted.  
- One bucket can be accessed publicly, and none have MFA delete (extra protection against accidental deletion).  

These gaps leave your data vulnerable. Fix the settings, enforce SSL, block public access, and enable MFA delete to secure your buckets.
