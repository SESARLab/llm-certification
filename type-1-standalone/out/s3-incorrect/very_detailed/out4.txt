Your AWS security check found that all 19 S3 buckets are not protected properly.  

• No public‑access controls – anyone on the Internet could read or write data.  
• No SSL‑only requirement – traffic can be sniffed in the clear.  
• No MFA‑delete – an attacker who gets credentials can delete or change files without a second factor.  

These gaps let attackers steal, modify or erase your data, exposing you to data loss, privacy breaches, and compliance violations. Fix the settings immediately.
