Your AWS storage (S3) buckets are misconfigured. None of them block public access, all allow non‑secure (HTTP) connections, and none have “multi‑factor delete” protection. In plain terms, anyone on the internet could see, download, or delete your files, even if the data were supposed to be private. This makes sensitive information vulnerable to theft, accidental leaks, or malicious tampering. Immediate patching of these settings is essential to keep your data safe.
