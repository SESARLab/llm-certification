The scan ran fine but found serious weaknesses in your S3 storage. All four key security rules failed: public access controls are missing, non‑SSL requests are allowed, one bucket is openly readable, and no extra protection (MFA delete) is set. This means anyone on the internet could see, change, or delete your files, risking data theft or loss. Fix these settings right away to lock down your data.
