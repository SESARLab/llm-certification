The probe found all 19 storage buckets have unsafe settings: they allow public access, accept unencrypted connections, and can be altered without a second confirmation. One bucket is openly accessible to anyone. This means sensitive data could be seen or changed by attackers, and data could be sent insecurely. Fixing these settings will protect data confidentiality, integrity, and compliance.
