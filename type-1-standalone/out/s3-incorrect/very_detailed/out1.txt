**What the scan found:**  
Your AWS S3 buckets have several mis‑configurations that could let attackers read, modify, or delete data.  
- **Public access controls** are turned off, so anyone could view or write to the buckets.  
- **SSL‑only traffic is not required,** meaning data can travel unencrypted over the internet.  
- One bucket (`musa‑webapp`) is still publicly accessible.  
- **MFA delete is disabled** on all buckets, so even authorized users could delete or overwrite files without extra confirmation.  

**Why it matters:**  
These gaps can expose sensitive data, allow tampering, and make it easier for attackers to compromise your applications or lose data permanently. Immediate configuration changes are recommended to protect your environment.
