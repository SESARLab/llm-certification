The scan found all 19 of your AWS S3 buckets are misconfigured. They allow public access, use no encryption‑only connections, and lack protection against accidental deletion. This means anyone on the internet could read or overwrite your data, and it could be removed without a second confirmation. The result is that sensitive files could be exposed, corrupted, or permanently lost, putting your applications and business at serious risk.
