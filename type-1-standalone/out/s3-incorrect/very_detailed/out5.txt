The probe ran correctly but reported 0/4 best‑practice checks passed. All 19 S3 buckets are mis‑configured: no public‑access blocks, no SSL‑only enforcement, and no multi‑factor deletion protection. This means anyone could read or modify your data over the internet, and a single click could erase records. The only risk was one bucket that is fully public, exposing your data to theft, loss, or unauthorized changes.
