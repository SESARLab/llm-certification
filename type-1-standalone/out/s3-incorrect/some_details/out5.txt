The scan worked, but your S3 buckets have several security gaps: none have the recommended access controls (public ACLs disabled, public policy blocked), all allow non‑SSL traffic, one bucket is fully public, and none use multi‑factor delete. These settings make your data vulnerable. Fix them to harden the storage.
