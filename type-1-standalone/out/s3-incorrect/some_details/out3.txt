The security check ran fine and found no known vulnerabilities. However, it identified 19 S3 storage buckets that are not properly protected: public access settings are enabled, all lack mandatory encryption controls (SSL only), and none have the extra protection of MFA delete. One bucket is still publicly viewable. These gaps could let attackers read or delete data. Enabling the listed settings will secure the buckets.
