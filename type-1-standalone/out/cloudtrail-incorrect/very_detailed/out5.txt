The scan found that two of the four CloudTrail checks passed – the logs are stored securely and cover all regions. However, two critical settings are missing: the logs are not validated for tampering, and the S3 bucket that holds the logs isn’t separately logged. Without these, attackers could hide their actions or alter records without detection, making it harder to investigate breaches.
