The security check ran fine and found that your AWS CloudTrail logs are correctly tracking all actions and are encrypted, which is good. However, the system isn’t validating that log files haven’t been altered, and the logs aren’t being sent to a separate, dedicated storage bucket. This means unauthorized changes could go undetected and the logs could be tampered with or mixed with other data.
