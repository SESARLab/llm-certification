Your AWS check found 2 of 4 settings OK. CloudTrail logs are enabled, encrypted, and cover all regions, so data is safely stored. But the logs lack file‑validation, meaning tampering could go unnoticed. Also, the bucket holding the logs isn’t monitored by another bucket, making it harder to detect unauthorized changes. These gaps let attackers hide activity or alter evidence, raising security risks.
