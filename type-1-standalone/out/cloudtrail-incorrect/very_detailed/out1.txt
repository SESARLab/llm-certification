The check ran fine and found two of four AWS CloudTrail settings are correct, but two are missing. The trail is encrypted and covers all regions (good). However, it doesn’t validate log files or send bucket‑access logs to a separate bucket. That means an attacker could alter logs or hide changes, making it hard to detect or investigate security incidents.
