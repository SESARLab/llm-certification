Your AWS security check ran OK. Two of four tests passed: logs are recorded in multiple regions and are encrypted.  
But two tests failed. The trail isn’t validating log integrity, so tampered logs could go unnoticed. Also, the trail isn’t sending S3 access logs to a separate bucket, making it harder to spot suspicious S3 activity. These gaps could let attackers hide their moves or alter logs.
