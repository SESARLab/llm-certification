The security scan found 2 out of 4 checks passed, but 2 failed. Your CloudTrail logs are encrypted and cover all regions, which is good. However, the logs aren’t verified for tampering and aren’t stored in a separate bucket, so if someone changes or deletes them, it could be hard to detect or investigate. This weakens your ability to spot hidden attacks.
