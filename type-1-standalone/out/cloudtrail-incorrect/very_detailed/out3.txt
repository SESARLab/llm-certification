The security probe checked four cloud settings. It found two good: trails are multi‑region, encrypted, and logged. However, two settings are missing—log file validation and separate access‑logging buckets. Without these, log tampering or untracked bucket access could hide attacks or data leaks. Fixing them will improve audit trails and help detect intrusions.
