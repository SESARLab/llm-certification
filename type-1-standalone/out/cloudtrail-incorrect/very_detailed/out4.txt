The security scan checked your AWS CloudTrail setup. It found that logging works in multiple regions and that the data is encrypted – good news. However, two important safeguards are missing: the logs aren’t validated, so tampering could go unnoticed, and the logs aren’t sent to a dedicated S3 bucket for extra protection. This means audit trails could be unreliable, making it harder to spot or investigate breaches.
