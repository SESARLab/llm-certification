**Quick‑look Summary**

- The security scan ran fine and found **2 of the 4 checks were OK**.  
- The only areas that need attention are two settings on your CloudTrail logs.

### What the report says

| Check | Result | Why it matters | What you need to do |
|-------|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| **CIS CloudTrail.1** (multi‑region trail) | ✅ **Passed** | A trail that covers all regions and logs every event lets you see what’s happening everywhere. | Good – nothing to change. |
| **CIS CloudTrail.2** (encryption) | ✅ **Passed** | All log files are encrypted with a KMS key, so they can’t be read if someone steals them. | Good – nothing to change. |
| **CIS CloudTrail.4** (log file validation) | ❌ **Failed** | Validation checks that the logs haven’t been tampered with. Without it, an attacker could alter logs to hide their tracks. | Enable *Log file integrity validation* for the trail. |
| **CIS CloudTrail.7** (S3 bucket access logging) | ❌ **Failed** | Logs that record access to the S3 bucket where the CloudTrail logs live help detect unauthorized reads or writes. | Enable bucket access logging and point it to a separate “audit” bucket. |

**Other notes**

- No CVEs (known software vulnerabilities) were found.
- The audit identified **one CloudTrail trail** (`MooncloudCisTest`) in the `eu-central-1` region that is the focus of the checks.

### Bottom line

Your CloudTrail is almost compliant—just two missing pieces:

1. Turn on **log file integrity validation**.  
2. Turn on **S3 bucket access logging** and store those logs in a separate, hardened bucket.

Once those are in place, the probe will report **all four checks passed** and your logging will be more tamper‑proof and auditable.
