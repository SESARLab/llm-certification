**What the assessment did**  
The probe checked how your AWS CloudTrail is set up – the service that records what happens in your AWS account. It looked at four specific best‑practice rules (CIS CloudTrail 1, 2, 4, 7) and compared what it found against what should be there.

**High‑level outcome**  
- **Successes (2/4)**: two rules were satisfied.  
- **Shortfalls (2/4)**: two rules were not satisfied.  
- No known CVEs were discovered.

### Rule by rule

| Rule | What it checks | Result | What’s happening |
|------|----------------|--------|------------------|
| **CIS CloudTrail.1** | At least one trail that records **global and management events** and spans **multiple regions** | **Passed** | Your trail `MooncloudCisTest` meets this. |
| **CIS CloudTrail.2** | **Encryption** – all trails must use an SSE‑KMS key | **Passed** | Your trail is encrypted with a KMS key. |
| **CIS CloudTrail.4** | **Log file validation** – each trail must verify the integrity of its log files | **Failed** | Validation is **not** turned on for `MooncloudCisTest`. |
| **CIS CloudTrail.7** | **S3 bucket access logging** – logs from the CloudTrail bucket must be sent to a *separate* bucket | **Failed** | Logging is not forwarded to a dedicated bucket. |

### Why the failures matter

| Failure | Why it matters | What you can do |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Log file validation** | It protects against tampering. If an attacker modifies a log file, the validation will detect it. | Turn on *Log File Integrity Validation* in the CloudTrail console or via CLI. |
| **Separate bucket for bucket access logs** | Keeps your CloudTrail logs separate from other S3 logs, making it easier to audit, protect, and delete the logs when needed. | Create a dedicated S3 bucket (or enable this option) and configure CloudTrail to send its access logs there. |

### Quick next‑step checklist

1. **Enable Log File Integrity Validation**  
   *Console:* CloudTrail → Trail → Edit → **Enable log file integrity validation**.  
   *CLI:* `aws cloudtrail update-trail --name MooncloudCisTest --enable-log-file-validation`

2. **Create a dedicated bucket for access logs**  
   *Console:* S3 → New bucket (e.g., `mooncloud-ct-access-logs`) → Set bucket policy to allow CloudTrail.  
   *CLI:* `aws s3 mb s3://mooncloud-ct-access-logs`  
   Then set CloudTrail to send logs there.

3. **Verify** – re‑run the probe or run the specific checks again to confirm the changes.

### Bottom line

Your CloudTrail is set up correctly in many ways (multi‑region, encryption), but it’s missing two important safeguards. Turning those on will strengthen the audit trail, help detect tampering, and make your logging more organized. Once those two rules are fixed, the assessment will show all four checks passed.
