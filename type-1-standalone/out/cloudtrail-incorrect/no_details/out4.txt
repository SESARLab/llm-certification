## Quick‑look Summary

| Test | Result | What it means |
|------|--------|---------------|
| **CIS CloudTrail.1** | ✅ Passed | Your CloudTrail is covering all regions and logs every event (read/write). |
| **CIS CloudTrail.2** | ✅ Passed | All logs are encrypted with an AWS KMS key. |
| **CIS CloudTrail.4** | ❌ Failed | Log file validation is *not* enabled. |
| **CIS CloudTrail.7** | ❌ Failed | The CloudTrail bucket doesn’t have separate access logging. |

**Overall:** 2 out of 4 checks passed – your environment is partially compliant with CIS CloudTrail recommendations.

## What the findings mean

| Check | Why it matters | What you see | What you should do |
|-------|----------------|--------------|--------------------|
| **CIS CloudTrail.1 – Multi‑region, global events** | Helps you see activity no matter which AWS region you use, and captures management actions (create/delete, IAM changes, etc.). | Your trail (`MooncloudCisTest`) is multi‑region and logs all events. | ✔️ No action needed. |
| **CIS CloudTrail.2 – SSE‑KMS encryption** | Protects audit logs from being read or tampered with if someone gets hold of the S3 bucket. | All logs are encrypted with a KMS key. | ✔️ No action needed. |
| **CIS CloudTrail.4 – Log file validation** | Detects if log files were altered after they were written. If it’s off, an attacker could modify logs to hide their tracks. | Validation is **disabled**. | ⚠️ **Enable log file validation** in the CloudTrail console or via CLI/CloudFormation. |
| **CIS CloudTrail.7 – Separate access‑logging bucket** | Keeps CloudTrail’s own logging separate from your main audit bucket. If someone deletes or changes logs in the main bucket, the separate bucket still records that action. | No separate access‑logging bucket is configured. | ⚠️ **Add an access‑logging bucket** for the CloudTrail S3 bucket (or enable S3 bucket logging to a separate bucket). |

## Next steps

1. **Enable Log File Validation**
   - In the AWS Management Console → CloudTrail → Traces → **Edit** → tick “Enable log file validation”.
   - Or run:  
     ```bash
     aws cloudtrail update-trail --name MooncloudCisTest --enable-log-file-validation
     ```

2. **Set Up Separate Access‑Logging for the S3 Bucket**
   - Create a new S3 bucket (e.g., `mooncloud-trail-logs-access`) with appropriate permissions.
   - In the original CloudTrail bucket’s properties, enable **Bucket Access Logging** and point it to the new bucket.
   - Ensure the new bucket has a restrictive policy (only CloudTrail and your auditors can write to it).

3. **Verify the changes**  
   - Re‑run the assessment (or use AWS Config rules) to confirm that CloudTrail.4 and CloudTrail.7 now pass.

### Bottom line

You already have strong foundations—multi‑region, global event logging and encryption. The two gaps are **log file validation** and **separate access‑logging**. Fixing those will give you full compliance with CIS CloudTrail guidance and improve the integrity and traceability of your audit logs.
