Your security probe ran correctly and found that **2 of 4 CloudTrail settings are OK**.  

- The trail is multi‑region and records all events.  
- It uses KMS encryption for log files.  

**Two issues need fixing**:  

1. Log file validation is not turned on.  
2. CloudTrail access logs are not sent to a separate S3 bucket.  

Update these settings to strengthen your account’s audit trail.
