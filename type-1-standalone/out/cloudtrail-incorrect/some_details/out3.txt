The probe ran correctly and checked four CloudTrail settings. Two were good: a multi‑region trail logs all events and its logs are encrypted with KMS. Two were missing: log file validation is off, and bucket access logging isn’t sent to a separate bucket. Fixing these gaps prevents tampering and ensures full audit trails.
