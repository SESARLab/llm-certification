Your cloud audit ran without problems. All four checks were satisfied:

1. A CloudTrail trail covers every region and tracks all actions.  
2. Trail logs are encrypted with a secure key.  
3. Log file validation is turned on.  
4. Access to the log bucket is logged separately.

In short, your trail setup is fully compliant and secure. No issues were found.
