The probe ran fine and found no problems. All four CloudTrail checks passed: logs are collected from all regions, encrypted with a strong key, signed so they can’t be altered, and sent to a separate bucket that tracks who accesses them. In plain terms, your AWS activity is being recorded securely, making it harder for attackers to hide and easier for you to spot any suspicious actions.
