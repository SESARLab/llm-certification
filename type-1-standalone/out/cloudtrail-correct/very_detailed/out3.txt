The security check found **no problems**. All CloudTrail logs are set up correctly: they cover every region, are encrypted, verify file integrity, and record where the logs are stored. This means your activity logs are safe, tamper‑proof, and easily traceable—so you’re protected against hidden changes or data loss. No immediate action is needed.
