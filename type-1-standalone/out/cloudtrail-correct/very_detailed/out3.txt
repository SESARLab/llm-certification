The security check scanned your AWS account’s CloudTrail logs, which record every activity. All four key settings passed: logs cover all regions and both read/write actions; they’re encrypted with AWS KMS; integrity checks are on; and access to the logs is logged separately. In short, your audit trail is solid, reducing the risk of undetected intrusions and making it easier to investigate incidents.
