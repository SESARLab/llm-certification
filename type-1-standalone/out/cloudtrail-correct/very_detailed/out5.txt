Your AWS audit‑trail setup passed every check.  
Logs are recorded from all regions, encrypted, integrity‑checked, and S3 access is logged to a separate bucket. This makes it very hard for attackers to hide or tamper with activity. With no errors found, the risk of malicious changes going undetected is very low, keeping your cloud environment secure.
