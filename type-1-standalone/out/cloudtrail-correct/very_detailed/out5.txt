Your AWS environment passed the security check. All CloudTrail logs—tracking every action in all regions—are enabled and encrypted. File integrity is verified, and logs are stored in a separate, monitored bucket. This means any changes, potential intrusions, or errors are recorded securely and can be audited. No configuration errors were found, so your applications are well protected against data tampering or unauthorized access.
