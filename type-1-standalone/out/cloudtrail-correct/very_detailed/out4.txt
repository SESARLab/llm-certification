Your cloud security check ran without any problems. All four CloudTrail rules passed: the logs cover every region, use encrypted storage, have integrity checks, and are sent to a separate bucket with its own logging. In short, your audit trail is set up correctly, so your application’s activity is safely recorded and protected against tampering or unauthorized access. No immediate security risks were found.
