**What the assessment did**  
The probe checked how your AWS CloudTrail logs are set up to make sure they meet the CIS (Center for Internet Security) benchmark. It looked at four specific best‑practice rules and confirmed that everything is working as it should.

**Results at a glance**  

| Rule | What it checks | Outcome |
|------|----------------|---------|
| **CIS CloudTrail.1** | At least one multi‑region trail that records all global and management events | ✅ **Passed** – You have a trail that covers all regions and records every type of event. |
| **CIS CloudTrail.2** | Trails must use KMS‑encrypted (SSE) storage | ✅ **Passed** – All trails are encrypted with a KMS key. |
| **CIS CloudTrail.4** | Log file validation must be enabled | ✅ **Passed** – Log integrity checks are on. |
| **CIS CloudTrail.7** | S3 bucket access logging must be enabled for a separate target bucket | ✅ **Passed** – Your trail’s S3 bucket is logging its own access. |

**Trail details**  
All of the above checks refer to the same trail:

`arn:aws:cloudtrail:eu-central-1:504548996914:trail/MooncloudCisTest`

It’s located in the `eu-central-1` (Frankfurt) region.

**Bottom line**  
Your CloudTrail configuration satisfies all four CIS controls that were examined. No vulnerabilities or compliance gaps were found in this assessment. You’re good to go!
