**What the report says in plain English**

| Item | What it means | What we found |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| **Probe status** | The tool ran and finished without errors. | “The probe executed successfully!” – all checks ran. |
| **CIS CloudTrail checks** | AWS recommends that you set up CloudTrail so you can see what’s happening in your account. The tool checked four common best‑practice rules. | **All four rules passed** – your Trail is in good shape. |
| **Rule 1 – Multi‑region trail** | A single trail should record events from all AWS regions so nothing gets missed. | ✔ Your trail *MooncloudCisTest* records all regions. |
| **Rule 2 – Encryption** | Log files should be stored encrypted with an AWS KMS key. | ✔ Encryption is on. |
| **Rule 4 – Log file validation** | CloudTrail can verify that the log files haven’t been tampered with. | ✔ Validation is enabled. |
| **Rule 7 – S3 access logging** | The bucket that stores the logs should itself log who is accessing it, and the logs should go to a different bucket. | ✔ Access logging is set up correctly. |
| **CVE findings** | The tool looked for known security weaknesses (CVE IDs). | **None found**. |
| **Trail name** | The only trail checked is `arn:aws:cloudtrail:eu-central-1:504548996914:trail/MooncloudCisTest`. | ✔ It satisfies every rule above. |

**Bottom line**

Everything the assessment checked is compliant. No issues or known vulnerabilities were discovered. You can consider your CloudTrail configuration “good to go.” If you want to add more trails or expand coverage, the same rules will apply. Otherwise, keep monitoring and keep your settings as they are.
