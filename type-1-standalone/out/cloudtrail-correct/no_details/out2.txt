**What the assessment says in plain English**

| Item | What was checked | Result | What it means |
|------|-----------------|--------|----------------|
| **Probe success** | The scan ran and finished without errors | ✅ “The probe executed successfully!” | The tool was able to talk to your AWS account and gather information. |
| **CIS CloudTrail – 4 controls** | These are the key security settings that the CloudTrail team recommends. | ✅ 4 out of 4 passed | All of the important controls are in place. |
| **1. Multi‑region trail & all‑events** | Logs every action that happens in all regions. | ✅ Passed – *MooncloudCisTest* trail is compliant | You’re seeing every event (both read‑ and write‑type) no matter where it happens. |
| **2. KMS‑encrypted log files** | CloudTrail log files are encrypted at rest with AWS Key Management Service (KMS). | ✅ Passed – same trail is compliant | Your logs are protected by strong encryption. |
| **3. Log file validation** | Checks that log files haven’t been tampered with. | ✅ Passed – same trail is compliant | You can trust that the logs are intact. |
| **4. Separate S3 bucket for access logs** | The S3 bucket that stores the CloudTrail logs also has its own access‑logging enabled, and it writes to a different bucket. | ✅ Passed – same trail is compliant | You can audit who accessed the bucket that holds your logs. |

### Bottom line

- **All four critical CloudTrail controls are correctly configured.**  
- **No security issues (CVE list is empty) were found.**  
- **The trail you’re using (`arn:aws:cloudtrail:eu-central-1:504548996914:trail/MooncloudCisTest`) is fully compliant.**

**Why this matters:**  
Having a properly configured, multi‑region, encrypted trail with validation and dedicated access logs gives you a reliable audit trail. It helps you detect unauthorized activity, comply with regulatory requirements, and investigate incidents quickly.

**Next steps (optional):**  
If you’re keeping an eye on other security areas, you might want to run the assessment again after you make changes or look at other CIS controls (like IAM policies, VPC flow logs, etc.). For now, your CloudTrail setup is in good shape.
