**Security Assessment – Quick Summary**

| Test | What was checked | Result | What it means |
|------|------------------|--------|---------------|
| **CIS CloudTrail.1** | At least one multi‑region trail that logs all management and data events | **Pass** | Your CloudTrail is capturing events from all regions and both read/write actions – good for a complete audit trail. |
| **CIS CloudTrail.2** | SSE‑KMS encryption enabled on all trails | **Pass** | All trail logs are encrypted at rest with AWS KMS – protects the logs from unauthorized reading. |
| **CIS CloudTrail.4** | Log file validation enabled | **Pass** | CloudTrail can verify that log files have not been tampered with – adds integrity assurance. |
| **CIS CloudTrail.7** | S3 bucket access logging enabled to a separate bucket | **Pass** | Any access to the bucket that holds the CloudTrail logs is itself logged in a separate bucket – helps detect suspicious bucket activity. |

**Overall outcome**

* **Result:** “The probe executed successfully!”
* **All 4 checks passed** – no configuration issues were found.
* No CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures) were detected.

**Bottom line**

Your AWS CloudTrail is set up correctly and fully compliant with these CIS (Center for Internet Security) controls. The logs are being captured, encrypted, validated, and their bucket access is also logged, giving you a robust security‑audit foundation. No immediate action is needed for these controls.
