**What the scan found**

The scan ran correctly (the probe succeeded). It checked one test: whether all file systems are encrypted. It failed – one file system, **fs‑11112222333344445**, is not encrypted. There were no other vulnerabilities or CVEs reported.  

**Action needed:** Encrypt that file system to meet compliance.
