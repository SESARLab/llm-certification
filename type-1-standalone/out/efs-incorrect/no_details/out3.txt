### What the report tells you

1. **The scan ran fine** – there were no bugs or timeouts in the tool itself.
2. **Only one item was checked** – the assessment looked at a single file system.
3. **That file system failed the encryption test** – it is stored unencrypted, which is a security risk.
4. **No known CVEs were discovered** – nothing in the scan matched a publicly listed vulnerability.

### Bottom line

The assessment is *complete* and *error‑free*, but it found one non‑compliant, unencrypted file system.  
**Recommendation:** Encrypt `fs‑11112222333344445` as soon as possible to meet best‑practice security policies.
