**What the report says (in plain English)**  

| What the tool tried to do | Result | What it means |
|---------------------------|--------|----------------|
| **Check that all file systems are encrypted** | **Failed** | The probe ran correctly, but it found **one** file system that isn’t encrypted. |
| **Overall success of the probe** | “0/1 succeeded” | Out of the one test it was supposed to run, zero passed. |

---

### Key Take‑aways

1. **The probe ran fine** – “The probe executed successfully!” just tells us the script/tool didn’t crash.
2. **A single problem was found** – the file system with the ID **`fs-11112222333344445`** is *not* encrypted.  
   * This means that data stored on that file system could be read by anyone who gains access to the underlying storage, which is a security risk.
3. **No other issues** – the report didn’t flag any CVEs or other vulnerabilities.

### Why encryption matters

- **Protection against theft or accidental exposure** – if the storage is wiped or copied, encrypted data stays unreadable.
- **Compliance** – many regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI‑DSS, etc.) require data at rest to be encrypted.
- **Defense‑in‑depth** – encryption adds a layer of security even if an attacker bypasses other controls.

### What to do next

| Step | Action | Why it helps |
|------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | **Encrypt the file system** – enable encryption for the specific volume (`fs-11112222333344445`). In most cloud providers you can turn on encryption when creating the volume or add it later. | Protects all data on that volume. |
| 2 | **Verify the change** – rerun the probe to confirm the issue is resolved. | Makes sure the tool now sees the volume as compliant. |
| 3 | **Automate future checks** – schedule this probe (or a similar compliance scan) to run regularly. | Keeps you alerted if new unencrypted volumes appear. |
| 4 | **Review other storage** – double‑check any other file systems or block devices you manage. | Prevents other, unreported, gaps. |

---

### Bottom line

The assessment tool worked correctly but found one unencrypted storage volume that should be protected. Encrypt it right away, confirm with another scan, and set up ongoing checks to keep your data secure.
