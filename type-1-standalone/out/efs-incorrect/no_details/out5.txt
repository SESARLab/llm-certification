**What the report is telling you**

| Item | What it means |
|------|----------------|
| **Probe ran without errors** | The security‑assessment tool finished its scan (`pretty_result: “The probe executed successfully!”`). |
| **Result of the test** | Only one test (EFS.1) was run and it did **not** pass. The raw summary says **0/1 succeeded** – zero tests succeeded out of one. |
| **Why it failed** | The test checks that file systems are encrypted. One file system (`fs‑11112222333344445`) is *not* encrypted. No file systems are compliant. |
| **CVE information** | None were found (`"cve": []`). |

**Bottom line**

Your system is missing encryption on one file system. To be compliant, you should enable encryption (e.g., use EFS, LUKS, or another encryption mechanism) on `fs‑11112222333344445`. Once that file system is encrypted, the test will pass and the assessment will show success.
