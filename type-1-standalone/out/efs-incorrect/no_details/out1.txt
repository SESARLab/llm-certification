**What the report says – in plain English**

| What we looked at | What the scan found | Why it matters |
|-------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| **Encryption of file systems** | One file system (`fs-11112222333344445`) is **not encrypted**. | Unencrypted data can be read by anyone who gets access to the disk.  That’s a serious security risk, especially if the data is sensitive or regulated. |
| **Other checks** | No other checks failed.  The scan itself ran without error. | The overall probe was executed successfully (“The probe executed successfully!”), so the test was reliable. |
| **Known CVEs** | None were identified. | No specific vulnerability identifiers were found. |

**What you should do**

1. **Enable encryption** on the flagged file system.  
   *If it’s an EFS‑managed file system on AWS, enable the EFS encryption option.*  
2. Verify that any data stored there is protected and that the encryption key is properly managed (e.g., using AWS KMS).  
3. Re‑run the assessment to confirm the issue is fixed.

In short: the assessment ran fine but uncovered a single security hole—one file system that’s not encrypted. Fixing that will bring the environment into compliance with your encryption policy.
