The probe ran fine but found one issue: one Amazon EFS file system (fs‑11112222333344445) isn’t encrypted. That means data stored there could be read or stolen if an attacker gets access, and it may violate data‑protection laws. To keep your files safe and stay compliant, enable encryption on that file system immediately. This simple fix will protect your data and reduce the risk of breaches.
