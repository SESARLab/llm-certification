The probe ran fine but found one issue: your AWS EFS storage bucket (ID fs‑11112222333344445) isn’t encrypted. Without encryption, any data stored there could be read by anyone with account access or intercepted during transfer. This could expose sensitive customer info, code, or business data, raising the risk of breaches and regulatory fines. Encrypting the file system will secure the data.
