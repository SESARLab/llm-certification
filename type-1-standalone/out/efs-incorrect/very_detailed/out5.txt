The probe found one issue: a file system (fs‑11112222333344445) is not encrypted. This means the data stored there can be read by anyone who gains access, so if credentials are compromised or someone gains unauthorized access, your data could be exposed or stolen. Encrypting the file system protects data at rest and reduces breach risk.
