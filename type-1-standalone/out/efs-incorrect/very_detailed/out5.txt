The probe ran fine but found one issue: the file system `fs-11112222333344445` is not encrypted at rest. That means any data stored there could be read in plain text if someone gains access to the storage, giving attackers an easier way to steal or tamper with your information. It’s a security weakness that should be fixed by enabling encryption for that EFS.
