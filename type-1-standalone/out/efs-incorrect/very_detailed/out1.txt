Your AWS security scan ran fine, but it found one problem: a file system (fs‑11112222333344445) is **not encrypted**. Without encryption, anyone who can access the storage could read its contents. This makes your data vulnerable to theft or accidental exposure and could violate privacy laws or internal security policies. Encrypting the file system would protect the data and improve compliance.
