The security check ran fine but found a problem: one Amazon EFS file system (fs‑11112222333344445) is not encrypted. This means data stored there could be read or tampered with by anyone who gets access to the storage. Encrypting it protects your information and helps meet security and compliance standards. The probe recommends adding encryption to secure the data.
