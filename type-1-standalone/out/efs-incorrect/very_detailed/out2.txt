The security scan ran correctly and found one problem: an Amazon EFS file system (**fs‑11112222333344445**) is **not encrypted**. Because its data isn’t protected at rest, anyone who gains access to the file system—or to the cloud account—could read, modify, or delete its contents. Encrypting the file system is essential to keep your data safe from leaks or unauthorized use.
