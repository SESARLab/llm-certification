The test ran fine, but it found one problem: one Amazon EFS file system (fs‑11112222333344445) isn’t encrypted. That means anyone who can reach it could read or copy its data without restriction. In practice this could let attackers steal sensitive information or modify files. Fix it by enabling encryption on the file system so all stored data stays protected.
