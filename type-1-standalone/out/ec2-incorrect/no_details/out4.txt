## Quick‑look Summary

| What was checked | Result | Why it matters | Current status |
|------------------|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Overall test** | ✅ 4 of 7 passed | Shows how many security “rules” are good | 4 / 7 ✔️ |
| **Default security group rules** | ❌ | A “default” security group that allows any traffic is a common entry point for attackers. | **Not compliant** – `sg-0c063b93959ff3eb5` is open. |
| **VPC flow logs** | ❌ | Flow logs record network traffic; without them you can’t investigate a breach. | **Not compliant** – `vpc-0fb33f847f5cb2033` has no logs. |
| **EBS encryption** | ❌ | Unencrypted Amazon‑EBS volumes can expose data if a volume is copied or accessed by an unauthorized user. | **Not compliant** – encryption is OFF. |
| **Instance Metadata Service v2 (IMDSv2)** | ✅ | IMDSv2 protects EC2 instances from “metadata injection” attacks. | All good. |
| **Network ACLs for SSH/RDP** | ✅ | Rules block public access to admin ports (22/3389). | All good. |
| **Security group remote‑admin restrictions (IPv4 & IPv6)** | ✅ | No open admin ports from the internet. | All good. |

### What it means in plain English

1. **Probe succeeded** – The scan ran without errors, but it found a few areas that need improvement.

2. **Default security group is too permissive**  
   * Think of it as a door that’s open 24/7 to anyone. If you leave that door unlocked, it’s easy for bad actors to get in. You should restrict inbound traffic to only what your applications truly need.

3. **Missing VPC flow logs**  
   * Flow logs are like security cameras for your virtual network. If something suspicious happens, you won’t have a record to investigate. Turn them on to keep an eye on traffic.

4. **EBS encryption is OFF**  
   * Your data on disk isn’t protected if someone gains access to the underlying storage. Enabling encryption ensures that data stays unreadable unless you have the key.

5. **IMDSv2 is enabled** – Great!  
   * This prevents a specific class of attacks that try to grab sensitive instance information from inside the instance.

6. **Network ACLs and security groups for admin ports** – All good!  
   * Your firewall rules correctly block public SSH (22) and RDP (3389) access, so remote administration isn’t exposed to the whole internet.

## How to fix the issues

| Issue | Quick fix |
|-------|-----------|
| Open default security group | Tighten inbound rules (e.g., allow only from your office IP or specific services). |
| No flow logs | Enable VPC Flow Logs for the VPC; send them to CloudWatch or an S3 bucket. |
| Unencrypted EBS | Turn on default EBS encryption in the account settings. For existing volumes, you’ll need to create encrypted snapshots and replace them. |
| (Optional) Re‑check after changes | Re‑run the probe to confirm all items now pass. |

### Bottom line

The assessment shows you’ve got a solid start: most firewall rules are correct and the instance metadata service is protected. However, leave a few doors slightly open and you’re leaving data at risk. Fix the default security group, enable flow logs, and encrypt your storage, and you’ll move to a “fully compliant” state. 🚀
