## Quick‑look summary

| Control | Result | What it means |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| **CIS‑EC2.2** | **✗** | The *default* security group in your account still allows traffic in and out – that’s a big exposure. |
| **CIS‑EC2.6** | **✗** | One of your Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) doesn’t have flow‑logging turned on, so you can’t see what traffic is coming in or going out. |
| **CIS‑EC2.7** | **✗** | Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes aren’t encrypted by default, so data at rest is unprotected. |
| **CIS‑EC2.8** | ✔︎ | All instances are forced to use IMDSv2 – a good protection against certain VM‑escape attacks. |
| **CIS‑EC2.21** | ✔︎ | No ACL (access‑control‑list) allows unrestricted SSH (22) or RDP (3389) traffic. |
| **CIS‑EC2.53** | ✔︎ | Security groups do not allow anyone from the internet to hit admin ports. |
| **CIS‑EC2.54** | ✔︎ | Same as above, but for IPv6 traffic. |

**Overall:** 4 of the 7 checks passed – so you’re on the right track, but there are a few critical gaps that need fixing.

## What the “bad” items actually mean

1. **Default Security Group still open**  
   - AWS gives every VPC a “default” security group that is automatically attached to new instances.  
   - The report shows that this group has inbound **and** outbound rules that allow traffic from everywhere (`0.0.0.0/0`).  
   - Anyone on the internet can now talk to any instance that is attached to this group, which is a security risk.

2. **VPC flow logs missing**  
   - Flow logs capture every inbound and outbound packet for a VPC.  
   - Without them you have no visibility into who’s connecting, what’s being accessed, or if there’s an attack in progress.  
   - The account has one VPC (`vpc‑0fb33f847f5cb2033`) that isn’t sending logs anywhere.

3. **EBS default encryption disabled**  
   - By default, EBS volumes are stored unencrypted on disk.  
   - If an attacker gains access to the storage backend or the instance itself, they could read the raw data.  
   - AWS can automatically encrypt any new EBS volume – you just need to enable it.

## Immediate next‑steps (quick wins)

| Issue | What to do next |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Open default SG** | 1. Go to *VPC → Security Groups → sg‑0c063b93959ff3eb5* (the default group).<br>2. Remove any inbound/outbound rules that allow `0.0.0.0/0` or `::/0`. <br>3. Attach a *tight* security group to each instance instead. |
| **Missing VPC flow logs** | 1. In *VPC → Flow Logs*, create a new flow log for `vpc‑0fb33f847f5cb2033`.<br>2. Point it to an existing CloudWatch Log Group or S3 bucket. |
| **No EBS encryption** | 1. In *Systems Manager → Parameter Store* or *Account Settings*, enable “Default EBS encryption”.<br>2. For existing volumes, you’ll need to create snapshots, delete the old volume, and re‑create it with encryption. |

## What’s already good

- **IMDSv2 enforcement** means your instances are protected against metadata‑spoofing attacks.  
- **Network ACLs** and **security groups** are not allowing anyone from the internet to hit SSH or RDP ports – good practice.  

---

## How to keep this clean

1. **Automate compliance checks** – run the CIS benchmark regularly (AWS Config rules or a tool like Cloud Custodian).  
2. **Label resources** – tag VPCs, SGs, and EBS volumes so you can audit and enforce policies automatically.  
3. **Review IAM policies** – ensure that only the necessary users/roles can modify security groups or enable flow logs.

### Bottom line

You’ve nailed most of the hard controls, but the default security group, VPC flow logs, and EBS encryption are still open. Fix those three items and you’ll be in a strong, compliant position. Once you do, run the assessment again and you should see all 7 checks pass. 🚀
