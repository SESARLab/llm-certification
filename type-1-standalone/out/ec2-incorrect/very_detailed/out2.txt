The scan found three small but important gaps.  
1. Your default security group allows any traffic in or out, so attackers could reach your servers.  
2. No VPC flow logs mean you can’t see who’s accessing your network.  
3. EBS volumes aren’t encrypted, so stored data could be exposed.  
Fixing these reduces the chance of a breach and protects your data.
