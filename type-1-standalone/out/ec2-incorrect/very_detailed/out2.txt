The scan found four of seven checks passed, but three critical misconfigurations remain.  
1) Your default security group lets any traffic in and out, exposing instances to the internet.  
2) No VPC flow logs means you can’t audit network traffic, making it hard to spot malicious activity.  
3) EBS volumes are not encrypted, so stored data could be read if stolen. Fixing these reduces data loss, intrusion, and compliance risks.
