Your AWS probe ran fine. It found three issues: 1) The default security group lets traffic in and out, exposing instances to anyone. 2) No VPC flow logs are enabled, so network activity isn’t recorded and would be hard to investigate after an attack. 3) EBS volumes aren’t encrypted, so data could be read if an attacker gains access. The rest—remote‑admin ports and IMDSv2—are properly secured.
