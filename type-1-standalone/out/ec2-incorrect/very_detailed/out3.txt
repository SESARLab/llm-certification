Your AWS environment was scanned. Four out of seven checks passed, but three areas need attention: 1) The default security group lets traffic in and out, making resources exposed; 2) No flow logs are enabled, so network activity isn’t recorded; 3) EBS volumes aren’t encrypted by default, so data could be read if accessed. Fixing these will close common entry points and protect data.  

All other checks, like restricting remote admin ports and using secure metadata, are good.
