The probe found three configuration problems.  
1. **Default security group** is open to any traffic, letting anyone reach your servers.  
2. **No VPC flow logs** mean you can’t see who accessed your network, so attacks may go undetected.  
3. **EBS volumes are not encrypted**, so data on those disks could be read if stolen.  

These gaps could let attackers access, exfiltrate, or alter your data. Fix them to keep the cloud environment safe.
