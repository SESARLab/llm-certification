The scan found three problems that could expose your AWS resources.  
1️⃣ A default security group still allows inbound/outbound traffic, so anyone could reach your servers.  
2️⃣ Your VPC has no flow‑log monitoring, so you won’t see who’s accessing the network or spot suspicious activity.  
3️⃣ EBS volumes aren’t automatically encrypted, leaving stored data vulnerable if someone gains file‑level access.  

Fixing these will tighten security and protect your data.
