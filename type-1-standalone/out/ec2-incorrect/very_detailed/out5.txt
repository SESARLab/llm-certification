Your AWS setup has a few security gaps. One default group still lets any traffic in, so attackers could reach your servers. The VPC isn’t logging traffic, so suspicious activity could go unnoticed. Your data on EBS isn’t encrypted, meaning if someone accesses it, they could read it. These weaknesses could let attackers infiltrate, monitor, or steal data from your cloud environment. Instance metadata is not protected, so a compromised machine could read data.
