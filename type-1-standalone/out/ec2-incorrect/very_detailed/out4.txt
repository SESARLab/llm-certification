The scan found 4 of 7 checks passed. Problems: your default security group still allows all traffic, your VPC lacks flow‑logging, and EBS volumes aren’t encrypted by default. These gaps can let attackers sniff traffic, see network activity, or access unprotected data. On the bright side, SSH/RDP ports are blocked, and your instances use the secure IMDSv2 API. Fix the open rules, enable logging, and encrypt storage to protect your environment.
