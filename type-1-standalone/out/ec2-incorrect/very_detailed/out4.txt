Your AWS setup passed most checks, but a few gaps could expose data or services. The default security group is open, letting anyone reach your instances. Traffic logs are missing, so you can’t see who is accessing your network. Your EBS volumes aren’t encrypted, meaning stored data could be read if accessed. Fixing these will tighten security, hide activity from attackers, and protect your data.
