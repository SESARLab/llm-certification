The security scan ran fine (4 out of 7 checks passed).  
• One default security group is too open – it allows incoming and outgoing traffic.  
• Your VPC isn’t logging network traffic, so you can’t see who’s connecting.  
• Your EBS (disk) storage isn’t encrypted, so data isn’t protected.  

All other checks (port restrictions, IMDSv2, ACLs) are fine. Fix the three problems to improve security.
