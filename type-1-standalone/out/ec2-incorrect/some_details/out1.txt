The probe ran fine. Out of seven checks, four passed. Issues found:  

- Your default security group still allows inbound/outbound traffic.  
- One VPC isn’t logging network traffic.  
- EBS storage isn’t encrypted.  

The rest (no public SSH/remote access, all instances use secure metadata) are fine. Fix the three problems to strengthen your security.
