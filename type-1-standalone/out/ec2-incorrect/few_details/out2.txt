The scan ran and found 4 of 7 controls passed. It flagged three problems: the default security group for your instance allows any inbound or outbound traffic, one VPC doesn’t record network activity, and your EBS volumes aren’t encrypted. All other checks (SSH/remote ports, IMDSv2, ACLs) are fine. Fixing these will strengthen your AWS security.
