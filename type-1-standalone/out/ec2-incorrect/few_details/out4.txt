The scan checked seven security settings in your AWS account. Four passed – your network ACLs and IMDSv2 use are fine. Three items need attention: the default security group allows all inbound/outbound traffic; one VPC has no flow‑logging, so activity isn’t recorded; and your EBS volumes aren’t encrypted, leaving data exposed. Fix these to strengthen overall protection.
