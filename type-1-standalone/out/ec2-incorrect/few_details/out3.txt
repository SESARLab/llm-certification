Your cloud security check found 4 of 7 safety rules passed. However, three important areas need attention:  
1. The default security group lets all traffic in/out, which is risky.  
2. One virtual network (VPC) isn’t logging traffic, so you can’t see who’s accessing it.  
3. Your data volumes (EBS) aren’t encrypted by default, so stored data could be exposed. Fixing these will make your environment safer.
