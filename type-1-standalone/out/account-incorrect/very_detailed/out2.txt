The scan ran correctly but found one problem: your AWS account has no alternate security contact set up. If a security issue happens, there’s no backup contact to reach, which could delay response time and leave your applications vulnerable. No known CVE vulnerabilities were found, so the main risk is missing a key notification channel. Fix the contact to improve incident handling.
