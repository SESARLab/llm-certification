The security test ran, but it found a problem: your AWS account has no alternate security contact set up. If an alert or incident happens, the system can’t reach a backup contact, so critical notifications might be missed or delayed. This could slow incident response and leave your applications exposed longer. Make sure to add a secondary security contact to improve your safety.
