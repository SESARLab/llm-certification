The security scan finished, but one key check failed. Your AWS account has no alternate security contact set up. If a security alert or breach happens, there’s no backup person to be notified, which can slow response times and leave vulnerabilities unpatched. Add a secondary contact so your team can act quickly and keep the environment safe.
