Your security check ran, but found one issue: **no alternate security contact is set up in your AWS account**. If the main contact is unreachable, alerts about breaches, needed patches or suspicious activity may never reach anyone, delaying response. Adding a backup contact ensures you’ll be notified right away, helping you react quickly and keep your applications safe.
