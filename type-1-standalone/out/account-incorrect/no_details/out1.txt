**What the assessment did**

| Item | What it means | Result |
|------|---------------|--------|
| **Probe executed** | The test script ran without crashing. | ✔️ “The probe executed successfully!” |
| **Tests run** | One specific check was performed. | 0 / 1 succeeded – the check did **not** pass. |
| **CIS Account.1** | The system should have a *security‑alternate contact* set up (a backup person you can reach if the main security contact is unavailable). | ❌ “No SECURITY alternate contact configured” |
| **CVE findings** | The scan looked for known software weaknesses. | None found. |

**Bottom line**

- The scan itself worked fine.  
- It found **no CVEs** – that’s good.  
- However, it discovered that your system **doesn’t have an alternate security contact** defined. That’s a gap you should address, because if the primary contact is unreachable, your security team could be left without a way to get help.

**Next step**  
Add a reliable alternate contact (email, phone, or both) to your system’s security settings. Once that’s in place, re‑run the check – it should now pass.
