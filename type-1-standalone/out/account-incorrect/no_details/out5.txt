### What the report says in plain English

| Item | What it means |
|------|---------------|
| **“The probe executed successfully!”** | The security tool ran to the end and didn’t crash or time‑out. |
| **“0/1 succeeded”** | Out of the **one** test it was asked to run, **none** passed. |
| **Test “CIS Account.1”** | The tool checked the configuration of your user accounts (specifically the *CIS* “Account 1” check). It found that you **don’t have a “Security alternate contact” set up.** That is a requirement for good security hygiene. |
| **CVE list is empty** | No known vulnerabilities (CVE‑identified) were found in the scope of this check. |

### Bottom line

- The assessment tool ran fine, but **it flagged one missing security setting**: you need to set up an alternate contact for security issues.  
- No other problems or CVE‑identified weaknesses were discovered in the part of the system it examined.

### Quick fix

Add an alternate contact (a second email or phone number) in your account security settings. Once that’s done, re‑run the assessment and the “CIS Account.1” test should pass.
