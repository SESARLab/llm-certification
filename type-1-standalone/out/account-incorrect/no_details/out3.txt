**Quick‑look on the assessment**

| Item | What it means |
|------|---------------|
| **integer_result = 1** | The scanner ran to completion – no fatal errors. |
| **pretty_result** | “The probe executed successfully!” – the scan finished. |
| **Summary (“0/1 succeeded”)** | One test was run and it **didn’t pass**. |
| **CIS Account.1** | The test that failed is a compliance check that requires a *security alternate contact* (an email or phone number you can reach if something goes wrong). The report says: “No SECURITY alternate contact configured.” |
| **CVE list** | Empty – the scan didn’t find any known CVE‑identified vulnerabilities. |

**Bottom line**

- The scan finished without crashing.  
- There are no known CVE vulnerabilities on the target.  
- One compliance requirement is missing: you need to set up a backup security contact to meet the CIS Account.1 rule.  

Adding that contact will clear the failing test and bring your environment into compliance with that specific CIS benchmark.
