**Security Assessment Quick‑Summary**

| Item | What it means |
|------|---------------|
| **Probe status** | The test ran without crashing – “The probe executed successfully!” |
| **Results count** | 0 out of 1 checks passed (so the single check failed). |
| **CIS Control 1** | The organization does **not** have a “security alternate contact” set up. This is a required contact point that can be reached in case a security incident occurs. |
| **CVE list** | No known CVE vulnerabilities were found during this test. |

### Bottom line
The assessment tool worked fine, but it identified one important gap: you’re missing a designated alternate contact for security incidents. Adding that contact will bring you into compliance with CIS Control 1 and help your response team act quickly if something goes wrong.
