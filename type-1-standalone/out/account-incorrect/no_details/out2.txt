**What the report says in plain English**

| Item | What it means |
|------|---------------|
| **Probe ran fine** | The tool that checked your system worked correctly – it didn’t crash or get stuck. |
| **“0/1 succeeded”** | The tool ran **one** test and that test **didn’t pass**. |
| **Test that failed – “CIS Account.1”** | This test checks a standard security control from the Center for Internet Security (CIS). The specific requirement is: **“You must have a SECURITY alternate contact set up.”** Your system does **not** have this alternate contact, so the test failed. |
| **CVE list is empty** | The assessment didn’t find any known Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures (CVE) that apply to your system. |
| **Result message** | “The probe executed successfully!” – just telling you the tool ran, not that all checks passed. |

### Why it matters

- **Alternate security contact**: This is a simple but important configuration. If someone in your organization needs to handle an urgent security incident, having a dedicated alternate contact ensures that someone is always reachable, even if the primary person is unavailable.

- **Compliance**: The CIS benchmark is widely used by security teams and auditors. Not meeting this control could cause you to fail an audit or weaken your overall security posture.

### Quick next steps

1. **Identify an alternate contact** – choose a trusted colleague who can be reached 24/7 (phone, email, messaging, etc.).
2. **Add the contact to your system** – most platforms allow you to configure an alternate contact in the security or account settings.
3. **Document the change** – keep a record of who the contact is, their availability, and how they can be reached.
4. **Re‑run the probe** – once the contact is added, run the assessment again to confirm the test now passes.

### Bottom line

Your security tool ran without problems and found **one configuration issue**: the absence of an alternate security contact. Fixing this will improve your incident response readiness and bring you into compliance with the CIS benchmark. No known software vulnerabilities (CVEs) were detected, so that part of your system is good to go.
