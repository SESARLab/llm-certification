Your cloud database (RDS) is set up correctly: it can’t be reached from the public internet, all its data is encrypted, and it automatically installs security patches. This means no outsiders can directly connect, your data stays protected, and you’re less likely to be affected by software bugs—overall, a very secure configuration.
