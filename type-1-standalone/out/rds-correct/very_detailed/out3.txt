Your AWS database is well protected. None of the databases can be reached from the internet, the data inside is encrypted so only authorized users can read it, and software updates are automatically applied. This means attackers can’t easily access your data, it stays confidential, and you’re less likely to miss critical security patches. Overall, the configuration is strong and low‑risk.
