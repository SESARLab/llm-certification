**What the report says in plain English**

| What was tested | Result | Why it matters |
|-----------------|--------|----------------|
| **No RDS databases are exposed to the public internet** | ✅ Passed – all your RDS instance(s) are private | Keeping a database private prevents attackers from trying to log in directly from the internet. |
| **All RDS databases are encrypted** | ✅ Passed – encryption is turned on for each instance | Encryption protects data even if someone gets physical or logical access to the storage. |
| **Automatic minor‑version upgrades are enabled** | ✅ Passed – auto‑upgrade is turned on | This keeps your database software up‑to‑date with the latest security fixes without manual intervention. |

**Overall status**

* The probe ran without any errors – “The probe executed successfully!”  
* All three checks passed, so your single RDS instance (`database‑1`) is currently following these CIS best‑practice controls.  
* No CVEs (common vulnerability identifiers) were found during this scan.

**Bottom line**

Your RDS setup is secure by these standards: it’s not publicly exposed, it’s encrypted, and it will automatically receive the latest minor security updates. Keep monitoring and repeat scans to stay protected.
