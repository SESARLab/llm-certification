**What the report tells us in plain English**

| What was tested | Result | What it means |
|-----------------|--------|---------------|
| **Are your database servers exposed to the internet?** | ✅ All 1 RDS instance (`database‑1`) is *not* publicly reachable | Only your internal network or VPN can reach the database. It’s protected from the open web. |
| **Is your database data encrypted?** | ✅ All 1 RDS instance (`database‑1`) is encrypted | Data at rest (and in transit) is protected with encryption keys, so even if someone accessed the storage they can’t read the data. |
| **Are automatic minor‑version upgrades enabled?** | ✅ All 1 RDS instance (`database‑1`) has auto‑minor‑version upgrades turned on | Your database will automatically receive critical patch releases (security updates) without manual intervention. |

**Overall verdict**

* The probe ran without errors (`"The probe executed successfully!"` and `integer_result: 0`).  
* All three CIS Amazon RDS controls that were checked passed.  
* No CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) were found for this environment.

**Bottom line**

Your single Amazon RDS database (`database‑1`) is properly isolated from the public internet, is encrypted, and will automatically receive the latest security‑relevant patches. The assessment found no security issues—great job keeping your database secure!
