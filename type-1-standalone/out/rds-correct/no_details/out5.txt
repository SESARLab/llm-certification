**What the report says in plain English**

| Item | What it means | Result |
|------|---------------|--------|
| **Probe status** | The security scan ran without errors. | ✅ “The probe executed successfully!” |
| **Overall outcome** | All three checks that the scan performed were passed. | ✅ 3/3 succeeded |
| **CIS RDS.2 – Public access** | No Amazon RDS database is open to the internet; all traffic must go through your VPC. | ✅ *database‑1* is private |
| **CIS RDS.3 – Encryption** | The database data is encrypted at rest. | ✅ *database‑1* is encrypted |
| **CIS RDS.13 – Automatic upgrades** | The database is set to automatically apply minor version upgrades, keeping it up‑to‑date with security patches. | ✅ *database‑1* has auto‑upgrade enabled |
| **Known CVEs** | No known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures were found for this instance. | ❌ None |

### Bottom line
Your single RDS instance (“database‑1”) is secure by the three CIS RDS benchmarks checked:

1. **It’s not publicly exposed** – only internal network traffic can reach it.  
2. **It’s encrypted** – data at rest is protected.  
3. **It auto‑upgrades** – it will automatically get the latest minor version security fixes.

There are no CVEs that the scan flagged. All checks passed, so your RDS setup is in good shape!
