**Quick‑look Summary**

| What we checked | Result | What it means |
|-----------------|--------|---------------|
| **RDS instance is not public** | ✅ All good | No one on the internet can reach the database directly. |
| **Database is encrypted** | ✅ All good | All data at rest is protected by encryption. |
| **Auto‑minor‑version upgrades enabled** | ✅ All good | The database will automatically get small, non‑breaking updates, keeping it up‑to‑date without manual intervention. |

- **Overall score:** 3 of 3 checks passed – the probe ran fine (`integer_result: 0` and “The probe executed successfully!”).  
- **No CVEs found** – the audit didn’t uncover any known vulnerabilities.  
- **Target:** The single RDS instance named **`database‑1`** satisfied every requirement.

**Takeaway**

Your RDS database is set up securely according to the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmarks for the three key controls we tested. Keep monitoring, but nothing urgent needs fixing right now.
