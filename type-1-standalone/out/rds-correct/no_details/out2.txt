**What the assessment found**

| Check | Result | What it means |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| **CIS RDS.2 – Public accessibility** | **Passed** | The one database you have (named **database‑1**) is *not* exposed to the internet. Only people inside your network can reach it. |
| **CIS RDS.3 – Encryption** | **Passed** | The data in database‑1 is encrypted at rest. Even if someone got a copy of the storage, they couldn’t read the data. |
| **CIS RDS.13 – Auto‑upgrade** | **Passed** | The database is set to automatically install minor version upgrades (patches, security fixes) as soon as they become available, so it stays up‑to‑date. |

**Overall**

* The probe ran without errors (`integer_result: 0` → success).  
* All three checks succeeded (`Summary: 3/3 succeeded`).  
* No CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) issues were found for this instance.

**Bottom line**

Your single RDS instance is in a very good state: it’s protected from public access, its data is encrypted, and it keeps itself patched automatically. Keep these settings in place, and you’re covering the key CIS controls for RDS.
